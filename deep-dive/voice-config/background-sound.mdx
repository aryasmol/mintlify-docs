## Overview
The **Background Sound** feature allows you to add ambient background noise during your agent's calls. This can help create a more natural and immersive conversation experience by simulating a realistic call environment.

## Enabling Background Sound

To enable background sound for your agent:

1. Navigate to your agent's **Configure** page
2. Find the **Voice Settings** section
3. Look for the **Background Sound** toggle
4. Enable the toggle to add ambient background sound during calls

<Note>
Background sound is disabled by default for all agents. When enabled, it will apply to all calls made by that agent.
</Note>

## When to Use Background Sound

Background sound can be particularly useful in scenarios where:

- You want to create a more realistic call center experience
- You're simulating a business environment
- You want to reduce the "artificial" feel of AI calls

## Best Practices

1. **Test First**: Always test your agent with background sound enabled before using it in production
2. **Consider Context**: Make sure background sound is appropriate for your use case
3. **Monitor Quality**: Ensure the background sound doesn't interfere with call clarity

## Technical Details

- The background sound is automatically mixed with the agent's voice
- The volume level is optimized to not interfere with conversation clarity
- The feature has minimal impact on call latency and quality

## Available Sound Options

Currently, a default office ambience sound is available out of the box. This provides a natural background noise that simulates a professional office environment.

<Note>
Additional sound options (like cafe ambience, outdoor environment, etc.) can be made available upon request. Contact our support team to discuss custom sound requirements.
