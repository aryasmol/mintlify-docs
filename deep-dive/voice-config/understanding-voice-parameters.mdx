## Overview  
AI-generated speech can be customized using various parameters to achieve the desired speed, clarity, and similarity to reference audio. Below are the key parameters that allow you to fine-tune speech output.  

---

## Voice Parameters  

### 1. **Speed (`speed`)**  
- **Description:** Controls the rate at which speech is generated.  
- **Default Value:** `1`  
- **Allowed Range:** `0.5 ≤ x ≤ 2`  
- **Effects:**  
  - Decreasing speed (`< 1`) slows down the speech, making it clearer but longer.  
  - Increasing speed (`> 1`) makes speech faster but may reduce clarity.  

---

### 2. **Consistency (`consistency`)**  
- **Description:** Manages word repetition and skipping to maintain speech fluency.  
- **Default Value:** `0.5`  
- **Allowed Range:** `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`  
- **Effects:**  
  - Lower values (`< 0.5`) reduce skipped words but may allow slight repetition.  
  - Higher values (`> 0.5`) prevent repetition but may cause words to be skipped.  

---

### 3. **Similarity (`similarity`)**  
- **Description:** Adjusts how closely the generated speech matches the reference audio.  
- **Default Value:** `0`  
- **Allowed Range:** `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`  
- **Effects:**  
  - Higher values (`> 0`) make speech resemble the reference voice more closely.  
  - Lower values (`0`) allow for more flexible voice generation.  

---

### 4. **Enhancement (`enhancement`)**  
- **Description:** Improves speech quality, with a trade-off in processing speed.  
- **Default Value:** `1`  
- **Allowed Range:** `0 ≤ x ≤ 2`  
- **Effects:**  
  - Increasing this value enhances speech clarity and naturalness.  
  - Higher values may introduce latency due to additional processing.  

---

## **Optimizing Speech Output**  
- Adjust **Speed** for fast or slow narration styles.  
- Fine-tune **Consistency** to avoid missing or repeated words.  
- Use **Similarity** to match a specific reference voice.  
- Increase **Enhancement** for the best quality, but balance it with latency needs.
