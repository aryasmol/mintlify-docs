## Setting Up Your Campaign

With your agent tested and your audience prepared, you're ready to create your campaign.

Navigate to the [Campaign](https://atoms.smallest.ai/dashboard/campaign) tab in your dashboard and click **Create Campaign** to begin.

### Campaign Configuration

Fill in the required information:

1. Campaign name - Choose something descriptive
2. Description - Optional details about campaign purpose or goals
3. Audience - Select from your previously created audiences
4. Agent - Choose which agent will handle the conversations

Review your settings and click **Create Campaign** to continue.

<Warning> Creating a campaign doesn't immediately start making calls. You'll need to activate it as a separate step. </Warning>

## Managing Your Campaign

After creating your campaign, you'll see it listed in the Campaigns dashboard. Click on it to access the management interface.

### Starting Your Campaign

To begin making calls, click the "Start Campaign" button on the right side of the campaign details page. Your campaign will immediately begin dialing numbers from your audience list.

The system makes multiple concurrent calls based on your subscription's rate limits. More information about limits can be found [here](https://console.smallest.ai/subscription).

### Pausing and Resuming

You can pause your campaign at any time by clicking the same button you used to start it. When paused:

- No new calls will be initiated
- Ongoing calls will continue until completed
- The campaign state is saved and can be resumed later

This feature is useful for:

- Stopping calls during non-business hours
- Making adjustments to your agent

### Making Changes Mid-Campaign

One powerful feature of Atoms campaigns is the ability to modify your agent while a campaign is running. Any changes made to your agent take effect immediately for new calls.

If you need to make significant changes:

1. Pause your campaign
2. Update your agent
3. Test the changes with a few manual calls
4. Resume your campaign when satisfied

<Note>

Best Practices

1. Start with smaller test audiences before scaling to larger campaigns
2. Monitor the first batch of calls closely to ensure your agent is performing as expected
3. Use the pause feature strategically to optimize calling times
4. Review campaign analytics regularly to identify potential improvements
5. Update your agent based on common user responses or questions
