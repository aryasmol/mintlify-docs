# Understanding Variables in Atoms

In **Atoms**, a **variable** is a container that stores specific information collected during a conversation. Variables allow your AI agent to remember and reference important details throughout the interaction, creating a more personalized and context-aware experience.

## Why Variables Matter

Variables are crucial for creating intelligent, dynamic conversations because they:

- **Maintain Context** - Remember key information throughout the conversation
- **Personalize Interactions** - Address users by name and reference their specific details
- **Enable Complex Logic** - Power decision-making based on collected information
- **Integrate with External Systems** - Pass data to and from webhooks and APIs

## Types of Variables in Atoms

Atoms supports several ways to create and use variables:

### 1. System Variables

These are predefined variables automatically provided by the platform. System variables are:

- Generated at runtime
- Read-only
- Always available throughout your flow

**Currently Available System Variables:**

| Variable     | Format             | Description                            |
| ------------ | ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Call ID      | `{{call_id}}`      | Unique identifier for the current call |
| Agent Number | `{{agent_number}}` | Phone number of your agent             |
| User Number  | `{{user_number}}`  | Phone number of the user               |
| Current Date | `{{current_date}}` | Current date in readable format        |
| Current Time | `{{current_time}}` | Current time in readable format        |
| Current Day  | `{{current_day}}`  | Current day of the week                |

### 2. User Input Variables

These are created dynamically when your AI agent extracts information from user responses.

**Example:**

When a user says, "My name is Sarah," the agent can automatically store "Sarah" in a `customer_name` variable.

### 3. Audience Variables

Audience variables are created automatically from the columns in your uploaded [Audience CSV](/deep-dive/audience/audience) file. Each column header in your CSV becomes a variable name that's accessible throughout your workflow.

**How Audience Variables Work:**

1. You upload a CSV file to create an audience in Atoms
2. Each column header in your CSV is transformed into a variable
3. When a call connects to a user from this audience, all their data becomes available as variables
4. Your workflow can reference these variables immediately without needing to collect this information

**Example CSV File:**

```csv
phoneNumber,customer_name,due_amount,account_type,last_payment_date
+919876543210,John Doe,250,Premium,2023-10-15
+919876543211,Jane Smith,175,Standard,2023-11-03
+919876543212,Robert Johnson,320,Premium,2023-09-28
```

In this example:

- `phoneNumber` is the required column for identifying contacts
- `customer_name`, `due_amount`, `account_type`, and `last_payment_date` all become audience variables
- When your agent calls John Doe, it can immediately access his data with variables like `{{customer_name}}`, `{{due_amount}}`, etc.

This powerful feature allows you to personalize conversations from the very beginning. For example, your agent can start the call with: `Hello {{customer_name}}, I'm calling about your outstanding balance of ${{due_amount}} on your {{account_type}} account. Your last payment was on {{last_payment_date}}.`

## Using Variables in Your Workflow

To reference a variable in your workflow, use the double curly braces syntax:

```
Hello {{customer_name}}, thank you for your interest in our restaurant.
```

This will automatically insert the value of the customer_name variable into your agent's response.

## Variable Best Practices

When working with variables in Atoms, consider these recommendations:

- **Use Descriptive Names** - Choose clear, meaningful variable names like `appointment_time` rather than `time`
- **Validate User Input** - Confirm critical information to ensure accuracy before proceeding
- **Plan Variable Usage** - Map out which variables you'll need throughout the workflow
- **Provide Fallbacks** - Include default values for essential variables

## Wrapping Up

Variables are powerful tools that make your AI agent more intelligent and context-aware. In the next section, we'll explore how to use branches to create dynamic conversation flows based on these variables.
