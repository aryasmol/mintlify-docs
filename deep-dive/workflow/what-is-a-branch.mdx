# Understanding Branches in Atoms

In **Atoms**, a **Branch** is a connector that links one **Node** to another within a conversation workflow. It determines the **flow** of the conversation, directing which node should be activated next based on user input or predefined conditions.

---

## Example: Restaurant Reservation Booking Workflow

Continuing from our **Restaurant Reservation Assistant**, branches define how the conversation moves forward based on the customer's responses.

1. **Greet & Ask for Reservation Intent**

   - **Branch 1:** If the user **declines**, transition to the **End Call Node**.
   - **Branch 2:** If the user **wants to book**, move to **Ask for Date & Time**.

2. **Ask for Date & Time**

   - **Branch:** Continue to **Collect Guest Details**.

3. **Collect Guest Details**

   - **Branch:** Collects the Guest details such as Name and Number of guests and proceeds to **Send Reservation Request** via the **Webhook Node**.

4. **Send Request (Webhook Node)**

   - **Branch:** If successful, transition to **Confirm & End Call**.

5. **Confirm & End Call**
   - **Branch:** Conclude the conversation.

## Creating a Branch in Atoms

To modify or create branches in your **Restaurant Reservation Agent**, simply click to **edit branches** and define the conditions for transitioning from one node to another.

## Parameters of a Branch

When setting up a branch, you can choose between two different types of decision-making logic by selecting the appropriate tab:

  className="rounded-lg"
  style={{ height: "400px", width: "auto" }}
/>

### Prompt Tab (AI Decision)

Use the Prompt tab when you want the AI to decide which path to take based on conversation context.

| Parameter              | Description                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Branch Prompt**      | A short decision label describing when this branch should be followed.                                       |
| **Branch Description** | A more detailed explanation of the condition or reason for this transition. Helps improve response accuracy. |

### Condition Tab (Variable Logic)

Use the Condition tab when you want to make decisions based on specific variable values extracted from the conversation.

| Parameter         | Description                                                                             |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Variable Name** | The name of the variable to check.                                                      |
| **Operator**      | The comparison operator (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, contains, not_contains, is). |
| **Value**         | The exact value to compare against.                                                     |

## When to Use Each Type

### Use Prompt-Based When:

- Decisions require natural language understanding
- Multiple factors need to be considered
- The logic is conversational or nuanced
- You want the AI to make context-aware decisions

### Use Condition-Based When:

- Working with specific numeric values
- Checking exact string matches
- Need deterministic, rule-based routing
- Variables have been extracted from previous nodes

## Examples

### Prompt-Based Example

**Node: Check Restaurant Availability**  
**Branch 1 (Prompt):**  
Prompt: "Restaurant is full"  
Description: "Choose this path when customer mentions the restaurant is fully booked"

**Branch 2 (Prompt):**  
Prompt: "Table available"  
Description: "Choose this path when a suitable table is available for booking"

### Condition-Based Example

**Node: Check Table Size**  
**Branch 1 (Condition):**  
Variable: `guest_count`  
Operator: `>`  
Value: `8`  
→ Routes to "Large Group Handling"

**Branch 2 (Condition):**  
Variable: `guest_count`  
Operator: `<=`  
Value: `8`  
→ Routes to "Normal Booking Process"

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Variable Names**: Use descriptive variable names in condition-based branches
2. **Detailed Descriptions**: Provide clear context in prompt-based descriptions
3. **Variable Validation**: Ensure variables exist before using them in conditions

## Wrapping Up

Branches form the backbone of conversational flow, ensuring smooth transitions between nodes. With the choice between AI-driven decisions (Prompt) and variable-based conditions, you can create more dynamic and intelligent workflows tailored to your specific needs.

In the next section, we'll explore the **different types of nodes** you can add and configure.
