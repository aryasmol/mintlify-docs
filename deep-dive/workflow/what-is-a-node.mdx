# What is a Node?

In **Atoms**, a **Node** is the foundation of every conversation workflow. It defines a **specific step** in the interaction, guiding the AI agent in its role—whether it's asking a question, gathering details, or making a decision.

<Tip>
Nodes focus on **what needs to be achieved**, not the exact words used by the AI. If you want precise scripting, enable the `Static Text` option.
</Tip>

## Example: Restaurant Reservation Workflow

Imagine you're building a **restaurant reservation assistant**. Here’s how **Nodes** help structure the conversation:

1. **Greet & Ask for Reservation Intent**  
   - *Goal:* Welcome the user and inquire about their reservation needs.

2. **Ask for Date & Time**  
   - *Goal:* Collect details on the preferred reservation date and time.

3. **Collect Guest Details**  
   - *Goal:* Gather guest count and any special requests.

4. **Send the Details to server**
    - *Goal:* Once the details are collected send them to server to register the booking.

5. **Confirm & End Call**  
   - *Goal:* Recap the reservation details, confirm the booking and end the call.

Each **Node** serves a clear purpose without enforcing rigid phrasing, ensuring a natural and flexible conversation flow.
