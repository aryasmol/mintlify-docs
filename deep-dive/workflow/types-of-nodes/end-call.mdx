## Understanding the End Call Node  

The **End Call Node** is a crucial component of an Atoms workflow. It serves as the **final step** in a conversation, ensuring that the interaction is **properly closed** once the Agent has completed its task.  

Unlike other nodes that guide the conversation forward, the **End Call Node does not have outgoing branches**, it simply **ends the conversation** at that point.

## Example: Restaurant Reservation Workflow  

Continuing with the **Restaurant Reservation Assistant**, here’s how an **End Call Node** fits into the flow:  

1️⃣ **Greet & Ask for Reservation Intent**  
   - If the user **declines**, the conversation **ends immediately** via an End Call Node.  
   - If they **proceed**, the AI continues to collect details.  

2️⃣ **Collect Reservation Details**  
   - The agent gathers the date, time, and number of guests.  

3️⃣ **Confirm & End Call**  
   - The AI **recaps the reservation** and confirms the booking.  
   - The **End Call Node is triggered**, wrapping up the conversation.

## Creating an End Call Node in Atoms  

Once inside the **Edit Workflow** canvas, follow these steps:  

### 1️⃣ Locate the Node Type Selector  
- In the **top left corner**, find the **Node Type Selector** and select **End Call Node**.  
- The node is added to the canvas automatically.

### 2️⃣ Connect the End Call Node  
- Drag a branch from the **last conversational node** to the **End Call Node**.  
- Ensure all conversation paths that require termination lead to an End Call Node.

## Parameters of the End Call Node  

When defining an **End Call Node**, the following parameters help configure its behavior:  

<img src="/images/end-call-params.png" className="rounded-lg" style={{ height: "400px", width: "auto" }} sub="df" />

| **Parameter**       | **Description** |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Node Name**       | Enter a label to identify the node (e.g., "End Conversation"). |
| **Action**          | Provide a short goal/prompt for what the agent needs to do (e.g., "End the call politely"). |
| **Static Text**     | Enables the node to use predefined static text rather than dynamically generated responses. |

Once these parameters are set, clicking **Save** finalizes the End Call Node setup.

## When to Use an End Call Node  

✅ **After Completing a Task**  
   - Example: The AI confirms a reservation and ends the call.  

✅ **If the User Declines to Proceed**  
   - Example: The customer does not want to book a table, so the AI politely ends the conversation.  

✅ **When No Further Action is Needed**  
   - Example: A support inquiry is resolved, and there is no need to continue the conversation.
