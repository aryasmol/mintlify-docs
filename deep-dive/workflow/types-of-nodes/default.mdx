## Understanding the Default Node

A **Default Node** is the most basic type of node in an Atoms workflow. It represents a **goal** in the conversation, what the AI agent needs to accomplish at a specific step. Unlike traditional chatbot scripts, where exact responses are predefined, **Default Nodes allow flexibility** by focusing on **intent** rather than exact phrasing.

## Example: Restaurant Reservation Workflow

Consider a restaurant reservation assistant. Below are some **Default Nodes** that define key points in the conversation:

1. **Greet & Ask for Reservation Intent**  
   - Goal: Introduce the agent and ask if the customer wants to make a reservation.

2. **Ask for Date & Time**  
   - Goal: Collect the date and time of the reservation.

3. **Collect Guest Details**  
   - Goal: Gather the number of guests and any special requests. 

Each Default Node **focuses on a specific conversational goal** without dictating the exact words the AI must use.

## Creating a Default Node in Atoms

Once you're inside the **Edit Workflow** canvas, follow these steps to create a Default Node:  

### 1️⃣ Locate the Node Type Selector  
In the **top left corner**, you'll find the **Node Type Selector**. Select **Default Node** and edit the parameters, it is added to canvas automatically.

### 2️⃣ Connect the Default Node  
- Drag a branch from the **last conversational node** to the current **Default Node**.


### Parameters of the default Node

When defining a node in a workflow, certain parameters help configure its behavior. Below is an overview of the key parameters that define a Default Node's behavior:

| **Parameter**                | **Description** |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Node Name**                | A label to identify the node (e.g., "Ask for Customer Name"). |
| **Action**                   | A short goal describing what the AI should do at this step. |
| **Use Global Knowledge Base** | Enables the node to pull information from a knowledge base. |
| **Static Text**               | Enables the node to use predefined static text rather than dynamically generated responses |
| **Start Node**                | Marks this as the beginning of the workflow. |
| **Loop Condition**            | Defines if/when the node should repeat (e.g., if the user provides incomplete information). |


After configuring these parameters, clicking "Save" finalizes the node setup.

## Best Practices for Default Nodes

✔ **Focus on Goals, Not Exact Phrasing**  
   - Instead of scripting exact dialogues, define the objective.  
   - ✅ _"Confirm the reservation details and ask if the customer wants to proceed."_  
   - ❌ _"You have booked a table at 7 PM. Do you confirm?"_

✔ **Keep It Modular**  
   - Break conversations into small, manageable nodes.  
   - Example: Separate "Ask for Reservation Date" and "Ask for Guest Count."

✔ **Use Clear & Simple Actions**  
   - Each node should **only handle one task**.  
   - If a node is doing too much, split it into multiple nodes.

## Summary

The **Default Node** is the foundation of any workflow in Atoms. It represents a **single conversational goal**, guiding the AI agent's responses. By structuring conversations with well-defined Default Nodes, you can create **flexible and natural AI interactions**.
