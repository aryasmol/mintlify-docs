## Understanding the Post Call API Node

The **Post Call API Node** is a specialized component in Atoms workflow that executes **after the conversation successfully ends**. It allows you to perform actions like updating external systems, logging conversation outcomes, or triggering follow-up processes.

Unlike Pre Call API nodes, Post Call API nodes:

- Can **only be attached to End Call nodes**
- Execute **only when the conversation reaches a proper end**
- Support both **sequential and parallel execution**
- Will **not trigger if conversation ends prematurely**

<Note>
  For handling all types of call events (completed, failed, busy, etc.), use
  Webhooks configured in the Agent Config page instead of Post Call API nodes.
</Note>

## Example: Customer Support Workflow

Here's how a **Post Call API Node** enhances a support workflow:

1️⃣ **After Conversation Ends**

- Updates CRM with conversation outcome
- Triggers follow-up email to customer

2️⃣ **Parallel Processing**

- Simultaneously updates multiple systems
- Records conversation metrics
- Schedules follow-up tasks

### 2️⃣ Configure API Details

- Set up the API endpoint and method
- Configure headers and authentication
- Define request body if needed
- Map conversation data to API request

## Parameters of the Post Call API Node

The Post Call API Node requires several parameters for proper configuration:

| **Parameter** | **Description**                                                |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Node Name** | Identifier for the node (e.g., "Update CRM", "Send Analytics") |
| **API URL**   | The endpoint URL to call                                       |
| **Method**    | HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)                                  |
| **Headers**   | HTTP headers for the request                                   |
| **Body**      | Request body (for POST/PUT methods)                            |

## Important Distinctions

🔄 **Post Call API vs Webhooks**

| **Post Call API**                            | **Webhooks (Agent Config)**                        |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Triggers only on successful conversation end | Triggers on all call events (complete, fail, busy) |
| Part of workflow design                      | Configured at agent level                          |
| Can execute multiple calls in parallel       | Single webhook per event type                      |
| Only processes successful conversations      | Handles all conversation outcomes                  |

## Summary

The **Post Call API Node** provides a powerful way to perform actions after successful conversations. While it's perfect for updating systems and triggering follow-ups after normal conversation endings, use Agent Config Webhooks for handling all types of call events.
