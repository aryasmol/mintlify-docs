## What is a Webhook Node?

The Webhook Node allows your workflow to **send or receive data** from external APIs, enabling real-time updates and seamless integrations.  
For example, in a **restaurant reservation workflow**, a Webhook Node can be used to **send booking details** to the restaurant’s database or **retrieve available time slots**.

# Example: Restaurant Reservation Workflow  

Continuing with our **Restaurant Reservation Assistant**, here’s how a **Webhook Node** fits into the flow:  

1️⃣ **Greet & Ask for Reservation Intent**  
   - The AI asks if the customer wants to make a reservation.  

2️⃣ **Collect Reservation Details**  
   - The AI gathers the date, time, and number of guests.  

3️⃣ **Send Data via Webhook**  
   - The Webhook Node sends the reservation details to an external system.  

4️⃣ **Confirm & End Call**  
   - The AI receives a response from the webhook and confirms the booking.  
   - The conversation ends with an **End Call Node**.

## Creating a Webhook Node in Atoms  

Once inside the **Edit Workflow** canvas, follow these steps:  

### 1️⃣ Locate the Node Type Selector  
- In the **top left corner**, find the **Node Type Selector** and select **Webhook Node**.  
- The node is added to the canvas automatically.

### 2️⃣ Configure the Webhook Node  
- Open the node settings and enter the required webhook details.  
- Connect the Webhook Node to the **previous conversational node** (e.g., "Collect Reservation Details").  
- Connect the Webhook Node to the **next step** (e.g., "Confirm Reservation").

## Parameters of the Webhook Node  

When defining a **Webhook Node**, the following parameters help configure its behavior:  


| **Parameter**                 | **Description** |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Node Name**                  | A label to identify the node. |
| **Action**                      | A short goal describing what the AI should do at this step. |
| **Static Text**                 | Enables predefined static text instead of dynamically generated responses. |
| **Action**                      | Defines the HTTP request type (`GET`, `POST`, etc.). |
| **API Link**                    | URL of the external API. |
| **Add Header**                  | Allows adding custom headers like authentication tokens. |
| **Body**                        | Defines the request body for `POST` or `PUT` requests. |
| **API Timeout**                 | Maximum wait time for API response. |
| **Is Async**                    | Determines if the request should be asynchronous. |
| **Extract to Variables**        | Enables extraction of API response values into variables. |

Once these parameters are set, clicking **Save** finalizes the Webhook Node setup.

## When to Use a Webhook Node  

✅ **Sending Data to External Systems**  
   - Example: Sending a reservation request to a restaurant’s booking system.  

✅ **Retrieving Information from an API**  
   - Example: Checking available table slots before confirming a reservation.  

✅ **Processing Payments or Transactions**  
   - Example: Integrating with a payment gateway to process deposits.
