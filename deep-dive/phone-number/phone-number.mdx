## Importing Numbers via SIP Trunking

If you already have phone numbers with your own telephony provider, you can import them using SIP Trunking (BYOSIP - Bring Your Own SIP). This allows you to:

- Keep your existing phone numbers
- Use your preferred telephony provider
- Maintain control over your telephony infrastructure
- Avoid number porting or rental fees

To import a phone number using SIP Trunking:

1. Navigate to the [Phone Numbers](https://atoms.smallest.ai/dashboard/phone-numbers/rent-numbers) tab in your dashboard
2. Click the **Buy Numbers** button in the top-right corner
3. Select the **Import SIP Number** tab
4. Enter your phone number details:
   - Phone number in E.164 format (e.g., +12025551234)
   - SIP Termination URL from your provider
   - Optional: Display name, username, and password for authentication
5. Configure your telephony provider to route calls to Smallest AI's SIP Origination URL
6. Click **Add Custom Number**

The imported number will appear in the [Your Numbers](https://atoms.smallest.ai/dashboard/phone-numbers/your-numbers) tab and will be ready to assign to any agent.
