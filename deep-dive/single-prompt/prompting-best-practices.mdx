# Best Practices for Single Prompt Agents

Designing effective single-prompt agents is less about length and more about **clarity, structure, and consistency**. A well-crafted prompt gives you far more predictable and high-quality behavior than an unstructured one. Below are some best practices to keep in mind:

---

## 1. Structure Your Prompt Clearly

The structure of your prompt is the foundation of your agent's performance. Using **Markdown** or another consistent formatting style help LLMs parse the instructions more easily.

A recommended skeleton:

* **Role & Objective** – Who the agent is and what "success" means in this context.
* **Personality & Tone** – The voice, style, and attitude the agent should maintain.
* **Context** – Relevant background, retrieved data, or domain knowledge.
* **Tools** – Available tools, usage rules, and how/when to call them.
* **Instructions / Rules** – Do's, don'ts, and approach guidelines.
* **Conversation Flow** – Stages, goals, and transition logic.
* **Safety & Guardrails** – Fallbacks, escalation points, and restricted behaviors.

Clear sectioning not only improves the LLM's adherence but also keeps your prompt **easy to maintain and extend**.

---

## 2. Write Instructions Simply and Consistently

Modern LLMs excel at following instructions, but **conflicting or overly complex directives** can create rigidity or unexpected behaviors.

* Favor positive phrasing: Instead of *"Do NOT…"*, use *"Always…"* or *"Prefer…"*.
* Break down complex rules into **short, digestible points**.
* Keep the instructions **unambiguous**—avoid overlap or contradictory rules.

Think of your instructions as a **step-by-step playbook**, not a legal contract.

---

## 3. Define Personality and Tone Intentionally

Your agent's **voice and tone** heavily influence the user experience. For example:

* **Professional & Formal** → Banking assistant, legal advisor.
* **Friendly & Conversational** → Customer support, lifestyle coach.
* **Playful & Fun** → Gaming or entertainment bots.

Be explicit in your prompt: state whether the agent should be concise, empathetic, humorous, persuasive, etc. Even subtle differences in phrasing can dramatically change how users perceive the agent.

---

## 4. Map Out the Conversation Flow

A strong prompt doesn't just define style—it **guides the conversation**. Break the flow into **logical sub-sections** (e.g., Introduction, Collecting Details, Offering Options, Closing).

* Define what signals **end each step** and when the agent should **transition** to the next.
* Explicitly write transitions: *"Once the introduction is complete, move to Collecting Details."*

This keeps interactions smooth, structured, and predictable.

---

## 5. Be Explicit About Tool Usage

If your agent integrates with tools, **teach it exactly when and how to use them**.

* Example: *"After collecting all patient details, call the `add_customer_details` tool before moving to the next step."*
* State whether tools should be **always called**, **conditionally used**, or **never exposed** to the user.

Clear rules ensure tools are triggered at the right time instead of randomly or too late.

---

## 6. Include Language Guidelines

If your agent supports multiple languages, specify:

* The **default language** to use.
* Whether the agent may **switch languages** mid-conversation.
* How to handle **code-switching** (mix of languages).

For example: *"Always respond in English unless the user initiates in Hindi. If switching, mirror the user's choice consistently."*

---

## 7. Balance Flexibility with Guardrails

Agents need flexibility to sound natural but also **boundaries to avoid risks**.

* Use **"do this" framing** for stylistic or conversational rules.
* Use **hard "never" rules** only for safety or compliance (e.g., *"Never share medical diagnoses"*).
* Include **fallback instructions**: what to do when the agent doesn't know, when a tool fails, or when the request is out of scope.

---

## 8. Iterate and Test Continuously

Single prompts are **living documents**. Test your agent in real scenarios, then refine:

* Adjust tone based on user reactions.
* Reorder instructions if conflicts appear.
* Add clarifications when the agent drifts or misunderstands.

---

✅ **Summary:** A good single prompt agent is structured, simple, consistent, and tested. Write like you're designing a blueprint: clear sections, concise instructions, strong tone guidance, explicit tool usage, and safety guardrails. Small refinements in wording often make the difference between a rigid, clunky bot and a natural, effective agent.
