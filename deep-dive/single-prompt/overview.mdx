## 🎯 Single Prompt Flow

The single prompt flow is the **simplest** way to create an AI agent. You are supposed to describe
the entire expected behavior in a single prompt - you can check out our [guide for best practices](/deep-dive/single-prompt/prompting-best-practices) 📚. 

For example - the below images shows the prompt for a very simple hotel booking agent 🏨:

## 🛠️ Tool Integration

On top of it, the agent can use **tool calls** to trigger real world actions like make an api call OR perform a knowledge base search 🔍. 
You can add multiple tools to your agent and refer them in your prompt via the tool name. 

For example - the restaurant reservation agent can be enhanced with a "transfer call" tool to 
forward corporate booking requests to a human agent 👤.
