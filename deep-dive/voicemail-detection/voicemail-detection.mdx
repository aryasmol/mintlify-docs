## Overview

Voicemail Detection is an intelligent feature that automatically identifies when a call reaches a voicemail system instead of a live person. When enabled, the system can detect voicemail scenarios and handle them appropriately by playing a custom end message before terminating the call.

This feature is particularly useful for outbound calling scenarios where you want to ensure your AI agent responds appropriately when encountering voicemail systems.

## How Voicemail Detection Works

### Detection Mechanism

The voicemail detection system uses advanced audio analysis to identify voicemail patterns by analyzing:

1. **Audio Patterns**: Recognizes common voicemail greeting structures and tones
2. **Speech Characteristics**: Detects the typical cadence and flow of automated voicemail messages
3. **Silence Detection**: Identifies the characteristic pause/beep pattern that indicates voicemail recording has begun
4. **Voice Detection Integration**: Works in conjunction with the voice detection system to ensure accurate timing

1. Navigate to your agent's configuration page
2. Scroll to the **Voice Configuration** section
3. Toggle **"Voicemail Detection"** to enabled
4. Configure your custom end text message

<Warning>
  If your voice detection release time is less than 0.6 seconds, voicemail detection may not work as expected.
  The system will warn you if this configuration issue is detected.
