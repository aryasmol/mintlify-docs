## What is the Atoms Widget?

The Atoms Widget is a React-based SDK that allows you to seamlessly integrate AI chat and voice functionality into any web application. Built with TypeScript and modern React patterns, it provides enterprise-grade reliability with minimal setup required.

## Getting Started

Before integrating the widget, you need to create an agent and configure your widget:

1. **Visit [https://atoms.smallest.ai/dashboard/agents](https://atoms.smallest.ai/dashboard/agents)**
2. **Create a new agent** or select an existing one
3. **Go to the Widget tab** to customize your widget's appearance and behavior
4. **Copy the generated embed code** from the UI for easy integration

<Note>
  **Quick Integration:** You can copy the complete embed code directly from the
  Widget tab in your dashboard. This code will include all your UI
  configurations automatically applied. You can also override any of these
  configurations programmatically if needed.
</Note>

## Installation & Setup

### For HTML/Vanilla JavaScript

**Simple Integration (Recommended):**
Just paste the embed code you copied from the dashboard:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/atoms-widget-core@latest/dist/embed/widget.umd.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Paste your embed code here -->
    <atoms-widget assistant-id="your-assistant-id"></atoms-widget>
  </body>
</html>
```

**Optional Customization:**
You can override dashboard settings by adding attributes:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/atoms-widget-core@latest/dist/embed/widget.umd.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <atoms-widget
      assistant-id="your-assistant-id"
      mode="chat"
      position="bottom-right"
      size="full"
      accent-color="#2d9d9f"
      title="AI Assistant"
      chat-placeholder="How can I help you today?"
    ></atoms-widget>
  </body>
</html>
```

### For React/Next.js Projects

First, install the widget package:

```bash
npm install atoms-widget-core
```

**Simple Integration (Recommended):**
Use just the assistant ID - all dashboard settings will be applied:

```jsx
import { AtomsWidget } from "atoms-widget-core";

function App() {
  return <AtomsWidget assistantId="your-assistant-id" />;
}
```

**Optional Customization:**
You can override dashboard settings with props:

```jsx
import { AtomsWidget } from "atoms-widget-core";

function App() {
  return (
    <AtomsWidget
      assistantId="your-assistant-id"
      mode="chat"
      position="bottom-right"
      size="full"
      accentColor="#2d9d9f"
      title="AI Assistant"
      chatPlaceholder="How can I help you today?"
    />
  );
}
```

## Use Cases & Examples

### Retail & E-commerce

**Faster shopping, product discovery, and returns help.**

Example: A shopper can ask, "Do you have this jacket in medium?" or "What's your return policy for sale items?" and get an instant answer, no scrolling through FAQs.

### Banking & Fintech

**Balance checks, policy info, and account troubleshooting.**

Example: A customer can say, "What's my credit card limit?" or "Help me reset my netbanking password" and the widget responds instantly, reducing call center load.

### Healthcare

**Appointment booking, doctor discovery, and pricing queries.**

Example: A patient can ask, "Find me a dermatologist available this week" or "What's the cost of a routine health check-up?" and even book an appointment right away.

### SaaS & Tech Support

**Onboarding guidance, error code resolution, and integrations.**

Example: A user can type, "How do I integrate this with Slack?" or "Why am I seeing error code 401?" and the widget walks them through solutions step by step.

## **Lead Capture into a CRM (Salesforce / HubSpot Example)**

The Atoms Widget can be configured to collect lead data during a conversation and forward it into your CRM (Salesforce or HubSpot).This requires **no backend coding** — everything happens inside the **Atoms dashboard \+ workflow editor**.

## **Step-by-Step Workflow**

### **Step 1: Collect lead details in the Widget**

- Configure your agent (in Atoms dashboard) to prompt the user for lead details:

  - Name

  - Email

  - Phone

  - Company (optional)

- These fields are captured during the conversation and stored as variables in your agent's context.

---

### **Step 2: Configure the Agent to Capture Leads**

The widget itself does not directly capture leads: you must configure your **Agent inside Atoms** to integrate with your CRM.

1. **Install the CRM Integration**

   - Go to the **Integrations Tab** in your Atoms dashboard.

   - Select **Salesforce** or **HubSpot**.

   - Authenticate and connect your CRM account.

   - Select which fields Atoms should read/write (e.g., `First Name`, `Email`, `Phone`, `Company`).

<img src="/images/widget/widget-step-1.png" className="rounded-lg" sub="df" />

Click on the Integration tab in the atoms page.

<img src="/images/widget/widget-step-2.png" className="rounded-lg" sub="df" />


Install and connect to your CRM.

2. **Open the Workflow Editor**

   - Navigate to your Agent → **Edit Workflow**.

   - Under **Integrations** in the left panel, drag a **Salesforce/HubSpot node** into your workflow.

<img src="/images/widget/widget-step-3.png" className="rounded-lg" sub="df" />


Select the CRM integration you need.

3. **Extract Variables in Conversation**

   - In the **starting node** (or wherever you ask for user details), add prompts like:

     - “What’s your name?” → `$name`

     - “What’s your email?” → `$email`

     - “What’s your phone number?” → `$phone`

     - “Which company do you represent?” → `$company`

<img src="/images/widget/widget-step-4.png" className="rounded-lg" sub="df" />


extract the variables you need for lead generation

4. **Add Salesforce/HubSpot Node**

   - Drop a **Create Record** (or Update Record) node into your workflow.

Map your variables into CRM fields using JSON-like format:

```json
{
  "FirstName": "$name",

  "Email": "$email",

  "Phone": "$phone",

  "Company": "$company"
}
```

<img src="/images/widget/widget-step-5.png" className="rounded-lg" sub="df" />


In the salesforce node ads the record data in a json format.

5. **Save & Deploy**

   - Once published, every time your Agent reaches this node, it automatically creates/updates a record in Salesforce/HubSpot.

   - No backend work is required.

---

### **Step 3: Confirm back to the user**

After the lead is captured, configure your Agent to send a confirmation message like:

“Thanks Jane, we’ve captured your details. Our team will contact you shortly.”

---

### **Step 4: Monitor & handle errors**

- If CRM authentication fails (wrong token, expired connection), you’ll see errors in the **Atoms dashboard logs**.

- Always set up a fallback message so the user gets a smooth experience.

---

## **Best Practices**

- **No backend required** → use Atoms’ native integrations.

- **Validate inputs** → configure conversation prompts clearly for email/phone.

- **Avoid duplicates** → use CRM upsert where available.

- **Monitor logs** → use Atoms dashboard logs to check failed syncs.
