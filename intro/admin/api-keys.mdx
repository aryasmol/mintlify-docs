# API Keys & Authentication

Access Atoms programmatically using API keys. Generate, rotate, and manage keys securely.

---

## Getting Your API Key

1. Log in to your [Atoms Dashboard](https://atoms.smallest.ai)
2. Go to **Settings** → **API Keys**
3. Click **Generate New Key**
4. **Copy immediately** — you won't see it again!

<Warning>
  **Security:** Your API key provides full access to your account. Never share it publicly, commit it to version control, or expose it in client-side code.
</Warning>

---

## Using Your API Key

### Environment Variable (Recommended)

```bash
export SMALLEST_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### In Code

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from smallestai.atoms import AtomsClient

# Automatically reads SMALLEST_API_KEY from environment
client = AtomsClient()

# Or pass explicitly (not recommended)
client = AtomsClient(api_key="your-api-key")
```

```javascript Node.js
import { AtomsClient } from '@smallest/atoms';

// Automatically reads SMALLEST_API_KEY from environment
const client = new AtomsClient();
```

```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://api.smallest.ai/v1/agents" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```
</CodeGroup>

## Key Management

### Multiple Keys

Create separate keys for different purposes:

| Key Name | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| `prod-backend` | Production server |
| `staging-backend` | Staging environment |
| `ci-cd-pipeline` | Automated deployments |
| `developer-john` | Individual developer |

### Rotating Keys

1. Generate a new key
2. Update your applications to use the new key
3. Test that everything works
4. Delete the old key

<Tip>Rotate keys periodically and immediately after any suspected exposure.</Tip>

## Key Permissions (Coming Soon)

Fine-grained permissions for API keys:

| Permission | Access |
|------------|--------|
| **Full Access** | All API operations |
| **Read Only** | GET requests only |
| **Agents Only** | Agent CRUD, no billing |
| **Calls Only** | Make calls, view logs |

---

## Rate Limits

API requests are rate-limited to ensure fair usage:

| Endpoint | Limit |
|----------|-------|
| Most endpoints | 100 requests/minute |
| Call initiation | 10 calls/minute |
| Bulk operations | 20 requests/minute |

Hitting limits returns `429 Too Many Requests`. Implement exponential backoff in your code.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `401 Unauthorized` | Invalid or missing key | Check key is correct |
| `403 Forbidden` | Key lacks permission | Generate key with correct scope |
| `429 Too Many Requests` | Rate limit hit | Add retry logic with backoff |

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use environment variables">
    Never hardcode API keys. Use `SMALLEST_API_KEY` environment variable.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="One key per environment">
    Separate keys for dev, staging, production.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rotate regularly">
    Rotate keys quarterly or after any team changes.
