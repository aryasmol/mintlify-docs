Atoms connects to your existing systems — CRMs, calendars, databases, custom APIs. Your agent reads data, takes actions, and keeps everything in sync.

## Pre-built Integrations

| Integration | What Your Agent Can Do |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **Salesforce** | Create leads, log calls, update contacts |
| **HubSpot** | Create contacts, log activities, update deals |
| **Google Calendar** | Check availability, book, reschedule, cancel |
| **Outlook** | Check availability, book, reschedule, cancel |
| **Stripe** | Create payment links, check status |

## Custom APIs

Connect any REST API:

1. Define the endpoint
2. Map parameters from conversation
3. Handle response in agent logic

Your agent can query order status, verify accounts, check inventory — anything your APIs support.

---

## Webhooks

Push call events to your systems in real-time:

| Event | When |
|-------|------|
| `call.started` | Call begins |
| `call.ended` | Call completes |
| `analytics.ready` | Post-call analysis done |
