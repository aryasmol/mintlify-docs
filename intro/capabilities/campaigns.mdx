Campaigns let you make thousands of calls automatically. Upload contacts, assign an agent, schedule the timing — Atoms handles the rest.

3. **Configure** — Set calling hours, timezone, retry rules
4. **Launch** — Start the campaign
5. **Monitor** — Real-time dashboard shows progress

```

Agent says: *"Hi John, I'm calling to confirm your appointment on January 15th..."*
