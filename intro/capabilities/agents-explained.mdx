An agent is an AI that talks on the phone. It understands what callers say, reasons through the conversation, takes actions, and responds naturally — all in real-time.

## What Agents Can Do

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Answer questions** | Pull from knowledge bases, policies, and FAQs |
| **Take actions** | Book appointments, update records, process payments |
| **Route calls** | Transfer to humans, escalate issues, route to departments |
| **Collect data** | Qualify leads, gather feedback, complete intake forms |

## Two Ways to Build

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Single Prompt" icon="message" href="/platform/single-prompt/overview">
    **One prompt, infinite flexibility.** You define personality and rules — the AI handles the flow. Best for support, FAQs, open-ended conversations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Conversational Flow" icon="diagram-project" href="/platform/convo-flow/overview">
    **Visual workflow builder.** You design the exact path — nodes, branches, conditions. Best for qualification, booking, structured processes.

| Aspect | Single Prompt | Conversational Flow |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Setup** | Fast — write one prompt | Longer — design the flow |
| **Flexibility** | High — handles unexpected topics | Structured — follows your design |
| **Control** | AI decides the path | You dictate the path |
| **Best for** | Support, FAQs, advisory | Booking, intake, qualification |

## How It Works

1. **Caller speaks** → Real-time speech-to-text
2. **AI processes** → Understands intent, retrieves context
3. **Takes action** → Calls APIs, queries knowledge base
4. **Responds** → Natural text-to-speech, sub-second latency

The entire turn happens in under a second. Callers experience natural, human-like conversation.
