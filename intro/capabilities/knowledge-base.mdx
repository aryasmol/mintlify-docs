A knowledge base lets your agent answer questions using your content — product docs, FAQs, policies, pricing. Instead of generic AI responses, your agent provides accurate, sourced answers from your actual documents.

---

## How It Works

1. **Upload** — PDFs, docs, CSVs, web pages
2. **Customer asks** — Agent searches your content
3. **Finds match** — Retrieves relevant sections
4. **Responds** — Answers grounded in your data

This is called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) — combining search with AI for accurate, hallucination-free answers.

## What You Can Upload

| Format | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| **Documents** | PDF, DOCX, TXT |
| **Spreadsheets** | CSV, XLSX |
| **Web content** | HTML, Markdown, URLs |
| **Structured data** | JSON |

## Why Use It

| Without KB | With KB |
|------------|---------|
| Agent guesses or hallucinates | Agent cites your documents |
| "I'm not sure about that" | "According to our policy..." |
| Generic responses | Company-specific expertise |
| Outdated information | Always current |

## Example

**Upload:** Return policy PDF

**Customer:** "What's your return policy for electronics?"

**Agent:** "You can return electronics within 30 days with original packaging. Would you like me to start a return for you?"
