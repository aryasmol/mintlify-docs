Voice settings control how your agent sounds. The right voice and configuration makes conversations feel natural.

## Voice Selection

Atoms supports multiple TTS providers. Each offers different voices:

| Provider | Voices | Characteristics |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| Smallest AI | lightning, thunder | Ultra-low latency, natural prosody |
| ElevenLabs | Many cloned/synthetic | Highest quality, more latency |
| OpenAI | alloy, echo, fable, onyx, nova, shimmer | Good quality, fast |

## Configuring Voice

Voice configuration happens at the platform level. In code, you can override settings per-session.

### Platform Configuration

Set your default voice in the [Atoms Dashboard](https://atoms.smallest.ai):

1. Open your agent settings
2. Navigate to **Voice Configuration**
3. Select a voice provider and voice ID
4. Adjust speed and other parameters

### Per-Session Override

Override voice settings for specific sessions:

```python
async def start(self, init_event, task_manager):
    await super().start(init_event, task_manager)
    
    # Get language preference from session variables
    language = init_event.session_context.initial_variables.get("language", "en")
    
    if language == "es":
        # Use Spanish voice
        self.voice_config = {
            "voice_id": "spanish-female-1",
            "speed": 1.0
        }
```

## Voice Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Range | Description |
|-----------|------|-------|-------------|
| `voice_id` | string | - | The voice to use |
| `speed` | float | 0.5 - 2.0 | Playback speed (1.0 = normal) |
| `pitch` | float | 0.5 - 2.0 | Voice pitch adjustment |
| `volume` | float | 0.0 - 1.0 | Output volume |

### Speed

Adjust speaking speed for different contexts:

```python
# Slower for complex information
self.voice_config = {"speed": 0.9}

# Faster for confirmations
self.voice_config = {"speed": 1.1}
```

Recommended speeds:
- **0.8 - 0.9**: Technical explanations, phone numbers, addresses
- **1.0**: Normal conversation
- **1.1 - 1.2**: Quick confirmations, casual chat

## Voice Quality Tips

### Keep Responses Short

Long text blocks sound unnatural when spoken. Break responses into conversational chunks:

```python
# Bad: Long paragraph
yield "Your order number 12345 was shipped yesterday via FedEx with tracking number 789456123 and is expected to arrive tomorrow between 2 and 6 PM."

# Good: Natural pauses
yield "Your order shipped yesterday."
yield " "  # Small pause
yield "It should arrive tomorrow between 2 and 6 PM."
yield " "
yield "Want me to send you the tracking link?"
```

### Use Punctuation for Pacing

Punctuation affects TTS timing:

```python
# No pauses (sounds rushed)
yield "Sure I can help you with that what do you need"

# Natural pauses
yield "Sure, I can help you with that. What do you need?"
```

### Spell Out Ambiguous Text

```python
# May sound wrong
yield "The price is $5.00"

# More reliable
yield "The price is five dollars"

# Phone numbers
yield "Your confirmation code is 1-2-3-4"  # Better than "1234"
```

## SSML Support

Some TTS providers support SSML for fine-grained control:

```python
# Add emphasis
yield '<emphasis level="strong">Congratulations!</emphasis>'

# Add a pause
yield 'Please hold. <break time="1s"/> I am checking that for you.'

# Slow down for a number
yield 'Your code is <prosody rate="slow">4-7-2-9</prosody>'
```

<Warning>
SSML support varies by provider. Test thoroughly before using in production.
</Warning>

## Handling Interruptions

When users interrupt, the agent should stop speaking gracefully. The SDK handles this automatically for `OutputAgentNode`, but you can customize the behavior:

```python
class MyAgent(OutputAgentNode):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            name="my-agent",
            is_interruptible=True  # Default is True
        )
```

To disable interruption handling:

```python
super().__init__(name="my-agent", is_interruptible=False)
```

Use `is_interruptible=False` for:
- Critical information the user must hear (payment confirmations)
- Very short responses that would complete before an interrupt registers

## Voice Testing

Test your voice configuration locally:

```bash
smallestai agent chat
```

Listen for:

1. **Natural pacing**: Does it sound rushed or too slow?
2. **Correct pronunciation**: Are names and numbers spoken correctly?
3. **Appropriate pauses**: Do breaks sound natural?

## Multi-Language Support

For agents supporting multiple languages, select voice per language:

```python
VOICE_MAP = {
    "en": "english-female-1",
    "es": "spanish-female-1", 
    "fr": "french-female-1",
}

async def start(self, init_event, task_manager):
    await super().start(init_event, task_manager)
    
    language = init_event.session_context.initial_variables.get("language", "en")
    self.voice_id = VOICE_MAP.get(language, "english-female-1")
```
