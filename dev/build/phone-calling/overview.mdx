The Atoms SDK lets you make outbound phone calls. Connect your AI agents to real phone conversations.

## What Can You Do?

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Outbound Calls** | Dial any phone number and connect it to your agent |
| **Call Control** | End calls or transfer to humans from within your agent |
| **Call Logs** | Access transcripts, recordings, and analytics |

## How It Works

```
Your App → SDK → Atoms Platform → Phone Network → User's Phone
                      ↓
                 Your Agent
```

1. **You initiate** — Call `start_outbound_call()` with a phone number
2. **Platform connects** — Atoms dials the number and establishes the call
3. **Agent handles** — Your agent runs the conversation in real-time
4. **You analyze** — Access transcripts and analytics afterward

## Prerequisites

Before making calls:

1. **API Key** — Get from [atoms.smallest.ai](https://atoms.smallest.ai)
2. **Agent** — Create an agent in the dashboard with a phone number linked
3. **Phone Numbers** — E.164 format (e.g., `+14155551234`)
