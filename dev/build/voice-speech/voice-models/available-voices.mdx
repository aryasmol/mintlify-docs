## Using Voice IDs

### In Platform Configuration

Set voice ID in the [Atoms Dashboard](https://atoms.smallest.ai):

1. Open agent settings → **Voice Configuration**
2. Select TTS provider
3. Enter the voice ID from the tables above

### In Agent Code

Reference voice IDs in your agent configuration:

```python
from smallestai.atoms.models import CreateAgentRequest

agent = CreateAgentRequest(
    name="SupportAgent",
    synthesizer={
        "provider": "smallest",
        "voice_id": "lightning",  # ← Voice ID from table above
        "speed": 1.0
    },
    ...
)
```

### Per-Session Override

Change voice dynamically based on context:

```python
class MultilingualAgent(OutputAgentNode):
    VOICE_MAP = {
        "en": "lightning",
        "es": "spanish-female-1",
        "fr": "french-male-1"
    }
    
    async def start(self, init_event, task_manager):
        await super().start(init_event, task_manager)
        
        language = init_event.session_context.initial_variables.get("language", "en")
        self.voice_id = self.VOICE_MAP.get(language, "lightning")
```
