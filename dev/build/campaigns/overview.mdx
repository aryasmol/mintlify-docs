**Campaigns** turn your AI agents into outbound calling machines. Define who to call, connect your agent, and let the system handle the rest—dial, connect, retry, track.

## What is a Campaign?

A campaign is the orchestration layer for outbound calls. It combines three things:

1. **Agent** — The AI that handles each conversation
2. **Audience** — The list of phone numbers to call
3. **Phone Number** — Your outbound caller ID

When you start a campaign, the system automatically dials each contact in your audience and connects them to your agent.

## Why Use Campaigns?

Manual outbound calling doesn't scale. Campaigns solve the operational side so your agents can focus on conversations.

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Parallel dialing** | Call multiple contacts simultaneously |
| **Automatic retries** | Failed calls retry based on your settings |
| **Progress tracking** | See called, connected, and completed counts in real-time |
| **Execution history** | Full audit trail of every campaign run |

## Campaign Lifecycle

Every campaign moves through these states:

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `draft` | Created but not yet started |
| `running` | Actively dialing and connecting calls |
| `paused` | Temporarily stopped; can resume |
| `completed` | All contacts processed |

You control the transitions: start, pause, resume, or delete.

## Key Concepts

### Audiences Are Reusable

An audience is just a contact list. You can run multiple campaigns against the same audience, or create new audiences for different segments.

### Retries Are Configurable

Set `maxRetries` (0–10) and `retryDelay` (1–1440 minutes) when creating a campaign. Failed calls—busy signals, no answer, network issues—automatically retry according to your policy.

### Metrics Are Real-Time

While a campaign runs, you can poll for:
- `total_participants` — Size of the audience
- `contacts_called` — Dial attempts made
- `contacts_connected` — Successful connections
