This guide walks through the complete campaign lifecycle—from setup to cleanup.

## Prerequisites

Before creating a campaign, you need:

- **Agent ID** — Create one with `new_agent()` or use an existing agent
- **Audience ID** — Create one with `create_audience()` ([see Audiences](/dev/build/campaigns/managing-audiences))
- **Phone Number ID** — Retrieve available numbers with `get_phone_numbers()`

---

## Getting Your Phone Number

`get_phone_numbers()` returns all outbound phone numbers available for campaigns:

```python
from smallestai.atoms import AtomsClient
from smallestai.atoms.campaign import Campaign

client = AtomsClient()
campaign = Campaign()

phones = client.get_phone_numbers()
phone_id = phones["data"][0]["_id"]
```

Each phone includes provider details:

```json
{
  "status": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "_id": "6963d3a8862e1cb702da7244",
      "attributes": {
        "provider": "plivo",
        "phoneNumber": "+912268093560"
      },
      "isActive": true
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Creating a Campaign

`create()` creates a campaign linking your agent, audience, and phone number:

```python
response = campaign.create(
    name="January Outreach",
    agent_id=agent_id,
    audience_id=audience_id,
    phone_ids=[phone_id],
    max_retries=2,
    retry_delay=30
)

campaign_id = response["data"]["_id"]
```

The response includes all campaign details:

```json
{
  "status": true,
  "data": {
    "name": "January Outreach",
    "agentId": "696ddd281ea16a73cb8aafbe",
    "audienceId": "696ddd287f45bf7b27344e7c",
    "participantsCount": 2,
    "maxRetries": 2,
    "retryDelay": 30,
    "status": "draft",
    "_id": "696ddd2a04ff172dbd8eddad"
    // ...
  }
}
```

### Campaign Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Campaign name (required) |
| `agent_id` | string | Agent to handle calls (required) |
| `audience_id` | string | Contacts to dial (required) |
| `phone_ids` | list | Outbound phone number IDs (required) |
| `max_retries` | int | Retry attempts for failed calls (0–10, default: 3) |
| `retry_delay` | int | Minutes between retries (1–1440, default: 15) |

---

## Starting a Campaign

`start()` begins dialing contacts in the audience:

```python
result = campaign.start(campaign_id)
```

The response confirms the campaign is processing:

```json
{
  "status": true,
  "data": {
    "message": "Campaign is being processed",
    "taskId": "081a5402-3f1f-4447-a257-6dd7bc6bad60",
    "campaignId": "696ddd2a04ff172dbd8eddad"
  }
}
```

---

## Monitoring Progress

`get()` returns the campaign status, execution history, and metrics:

```python
status = campaign.get(campaign_id)

data = status["data"]["campaign"]
metrics = status["data"]["metrics"]

print(f"Status: {data['status']}")
print(f"Called: {metrics['contacts_called']}/{metrics['total_participants']}")
print(f"Connected: {metrics['contacts_connected']}")
```

Full status response:

```json
{
  "status": true,
  "data": {
    "campaign": {
      "status": "running",
      "executions": [
        {
          "executionNumber": 1,
          "status": "completed",
          "totalMembers": 2,
          "processedMembers": 2
        }
      ]
    },
    // ...
    "metrics": {
      "total_participants": 2,
      "contacts_called": 2,
      "contacts_connected": 1
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Cleaning Up

`delete()` removes the campaign and its execution history:

```python
campaign.delete(campaign_id)
```

<Note>
Running campaigns should be paused before deletion. Use `pause(id)` first if needed.

## Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why are contacts_called and contacts_connected different?">
    `contacts_called` counts dial attempts. `contacts_connected` counts answered calls. The difference represents voicemail, busy signals, and no-answers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens when a call fails?">
    Failed calls enter the retry queue based on your `max_retries` and `retry_delay` settings. After all retries are exhausted, the contact is marked as failed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I run multiple campaigns simultaneously?">
    Yes. Each campaign operates independently. Just ensure you have sufficient phone capacity for parallel dialing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I change an agent mid-campaign?">
    Campaigns cannot change agents after creation. Create a new campaign with the desired agent and audience.
