An **Audience** is a curated list of phone numbers your campaigns will dial. Think of it as a segment—leads to call, customers to survey, appointments to confirm.

## Creating an Audience

Use `create_audience` with a list of phone numbers and optional contact names:

```python
from smallestai.atoms.audience import Audience

audience = Audience()

response = audience.create(
    name="Q1 Sales Leads",
    phone_numbers=["+916366821717", "+919353662554"],
    names=[("John", "Doe"), ("Jane", "Smith")]
)

audience_id = response["data"]["_id"]
```

The response confirms creation with the audience ID:

```json
{
  "status": true,
  "data": {
    "name": "Q1 Sales Leads",
    "phoneNumberColumnName": "phoneNumber",
    "_id": "696ddd56b905442f52b71392"
  }
}
```

<Note>
Phone numbers must use E.164 format: `+` followed by country code and number. Example: `+916366821717`
</Note>

## Listing Audiences

`list()` returns all audiences with their campaign associations:

```python
audiences = audience.list()
```

Each audience includes campaign associations and member counts:

```json
{
  "status": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "_id": "696ddd56b905442f52b71392",
      "name": "Q1 Sales Leads",
      "memberCount": 2,
      "hasCampaigns": true,
      "campaigns": [
        {"_id": "...", "name": "January Outreach", "status": "completed"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Viewing Members

`get_members()` returns a paginated list of contacts in the audience:

```python
members = audience.get_members(
    audience_id=audience_id,
    page=1,
    offset=10
)
```

Each member stores their contact data:

```json
{
  "status": true,
  "data": {
    "members": [
      {
        "_id": "696ddd56b905442f52b71394",
        "data": {
          "firstName": "John",
          "lastName": "Doe",
          "phoneNumber": "+916366821717"
        }
      }
    ],
    "totalCount": 2,
    "totalPages": 1,
    "hasMore": false
  }
}
```

---

## Adding Members

`add_contacts()` appends new contacts to an existing audience:

```python
audience.add_contacts(
    audience_id=audience_id,
    phone_numbers=["+919876543210"],
    names=[("New", "Contact")]
)
```

The response reports how many were added:

```json
{
  "status": true,
  "data": [{"message": "1 members added successfully", "data": {"added": 1, "skipped": 0}}]
}
```

---

## Deleting an Audience

`delete()` removes the audience and all its members:

```python
audience.delete(audience_id=audience_id)
```

<Warning>
Audiences with active campaigns cannot be deleted. Complete or delete the campaigns first.
</Warning>

## Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What phone number format should I use?">
    E.164 format is required: `+` followed by country code and number with no spaces or dashes. Example: `+14155551234` for US, `+916366821717` for India.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I update existing member data?">
    Currently, you can add new members but not update existing ones. To change a contact's info, delete and recreate the audience or add the corrected record (duplicates are skipped).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How many members can an audience have?">
    Audiences can scale to thousands of contacts. For very large lists, consider splitting into segments for easier management.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why was my member skipped?">
    Members with duplicate phone numbers within the same audience are skipped. Check that each phone number is unique.
