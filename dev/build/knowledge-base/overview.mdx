A **Knowledge Base** (KB) is a searchable container for your content. Upload documents, FAQs, and product information, and your agent can answer questions based on that data automatically.

When a user asks a question, the platform searches your KB, finds relevant content, and includes it in the LLM's context—so your agent answers using real information instead of making things up.
