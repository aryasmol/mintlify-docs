A **Knowledge Base** is a collection of documents your agent can reference during conversations. Instead of relying solely on the LLM's training data, agents with a knowledge base provide answers grounded in *your* information.

## Why Knowledge Bases Matter

LLMs are powerful but imperfect. They hallucinate facts, go out of date, and know nothing about your specific business. Knowledge bases solve this.

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Hallucination** | Agent answers from verified documents, not imagination |
| **Stale data** | Update your KB anytime; agent always has current info |
| **Domain gaps** | Upload product specs, policies, FAQs—whatever your domain needs |
| **Consistency** | Every agent using the same KB gives the same answers |

## How It Works

When a user asks a question:

1. The agent searches the knowledge base for relevant content
2. Matching passages are injected into the LLM context
3. The agent responds using this grounded information

This is called **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**—your agent retrieves before it generates.

## Use Cases

- **Product Support** — Upload manuals, troubleshooting guides, warranty policies. Agents answer product questions accurately.
- **Sales Enablement** — Add pricing sheets, feature comparisons, objection handlers. Agents sell with confidence.
- **HR & Onboarding** — Store employee handbooks, benefits info, org charts. New hire questions handled instantly.
- **Legal & Compliance** — Include policies, regulations, approved language. Agents stay within bounds.

## Key Concepts

### One Agent, One KB

Each agent can link to one knowledge base via the `globalKnowledgeBaseId` field. This becomes the default source for all conversations with that agent.

### KB Independence

Knowledge bases exist independently of agents. You can:
- Create a KB first, then link agents later
- Reuse one KB across multiple agents
- Update KB content without touching agent configuration

### Document Types

Currently supported:
- **PDF files** via the upload endpoint
- **Text content** (when the text upload endpoint is deployed)
