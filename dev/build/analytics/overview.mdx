**Analytics** gives you complete visibility into what happens during and after every call your agents handle.

## What Can You Track?

Every call generates rich data that you can access programmatically:

| Category | Data Available |
|----------|----------------|
| **Call Details** | Duration, status, phone numbers, timestamps |
| **Transcript** | Full conversation text with speaker labels |
| **Recordings** | Mono and stereo audio files |
| **AI Summaries** | Auto-generated call summaries |
| **Disposition Metrics** | Extracted data points you define |
| **Performance** | Latency breakdowns per component |
| **Cost** | Credits consumed per call |

## How It Works

1. **During the call** — Events are logged in real-time (status changes, transcription, speech)
2. **After the call** — AI processes the transcript to generate summaries and extract configured metrics
3. **On demand** — SDK methods let you query, filter, and search call data

## SDK Methods

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `get_calls()` | List calls with filters |
| `get_call(id)` | Get single call details |
| `search_calls(ids)` | Batch fetch by call IDs |
| `get_post_call_config(agent_id)` | Get agent's analytics config |
| `set_post_call_config(agent_id, ...)` | Configure post-call extraction |
