The Atoms SDK is built around a **graph-based architecture** where information flows between processing units. This design makes it easy to build everything from simple chatbots to complex multi-agent systems.

## How It Works

Every voice conversation in Atoms follows this pattern:

1. **Audio comes in** — The user speaks into their phone or browser
2. **Events flow through nodes** — Speech is transcribed, processed, and responses generated
3. **Audio goes out** — The agent's response is synthesized and played back

The system manages all the complexity of real-time streaming, interruptions, and state management. You just focus on the logic.
