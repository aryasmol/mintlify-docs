Integrations let your agent connect directly to external services like CRMs — without custom API configuration. Click, authenticate, and you're connected.

## Available Integrations

We support integrations with Salesforce, Zendesk, Zoho, Fiserv, TSYS, and more.

Some integrations (like Salesforce) are available to install directly. Others show **Talk to Sales** — reach out and we'll enable them for your account.
