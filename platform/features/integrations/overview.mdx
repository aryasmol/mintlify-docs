## What You Can Do

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Customer Lookup" icon="search">
    When a call comes in:
    1. Atoms checks caller ID against your CRM
    2. Retrieves customer name, history, account status
    3. Agent uses this context in the conversation
    
    *"Hi Sarah! I see you're a gold member. How can I help today?"*
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Appointment Booking" icon="calendar-check">
    During the call:
    1. Agent asks for preferred date/time
    2. Atoms checks calendar availability
    3. Books the appointment in your system
    4. Sends confirmation
    
    *"I've booked you for Tuesday at 2pm with Dr. Johnson. You'll receive a confirmation email shortly."*
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Activity Logging" icon="list-check">
    After every call:
    1. Atoms sends call details to your CRM
    2. Creates activity/note on contact record
    3. Includes duration, outcome, summary

## Using Integrations with Agents

       ↓
[Pre-Call: Fetch from CRM] → Populates {{customer_name}}, etc.
       ↓
[Conversation with context]
       ↓
[Post-Call: Log to CRM]
```
