## Using Calendar in Agents

### Single Prompt Agent

Enable calendar tools in your agent:

```
CALENDAR INTEGRATION:
Your agent can check availability and book appointments.

When the customer wants to schedule:
1. Ask what type of appointment they need
2. Ask for their preferred date
3. Check availability and offer 2-3 options
4. Confirm their selection
5. Book the appointment
6. Confirm details and send to their email

Available appointment types:
- Consultation (30 min)
- Follow-up (15 min)
```

### Convo Flow Agent

Use API nodes to interact with calendar:

```
[Collect Preferred Date]
        ↓
[API: Check Availability]
        ↓
   ┌────┴────┐
Slots Found  No Slots
   ↓            ↓
[Offer Options] [Suggest Alternatives]
   ↓
[Confirm Selection]
        ↓
[API: Book Appointment]
        ↓
[Confirm Booking]
```

## Example Conversation

```
Customer: "I'd like to schedule an appointment."

Agent: "I'd be happy to help you schedule. What day works best for you?"

Customer: "How about next Tuesday?"

Agent: "Let me check Tuesday for you... I have openings at 
        9:00 AM, 11:30 AM, and 2:00 PM. Which works best?"

Customer: "2:00 PM works."

Agent: "Great! I've booked you for Tuesday, January 23rd at 2:00 PM. 
        You'll receive a calendar invite at the email on file. 
        Is there anything else I can help with?"
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Offer Limited Options" icon="list-ol">
    Don't overwhelm with every available slot:
    
    **Better:** "I have 9 AM, 2 PM, and 4:30 PM available."
    
    **Worse:** "I have 9, 9:30, 10, 10:30, 11, 11:30..." (too many)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Confirm All Details" icon="check">
    Before booking, confirm:
    - Date and time
    - Customer name
    - Contact info (email/phone)
    - Appointment type
    
    "Just to confirm: That's Tuesday the 23rd at 2 PM for a consultation. Is that correct?"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Handle Time Zones" icon="globe">
    Always clarify time zone:
    
    "That's 2 PM Eastern Time. Does that work for you?"
    
    Or detect from caller's phone number when possible.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Send Confirmations" icon="envelope">
    After booking:
    - Send calendar invite
    - Include video link if virtual
    - Add any preparation instructions
  </Accordion>
