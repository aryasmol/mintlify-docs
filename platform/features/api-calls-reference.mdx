API Calls let your agent interact with external systems during conversations — fetch customer data, book appointments, update CRMs, process payments.

## API Call Types

| Type | When It Runs | Use Case |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Pre-Call** | Before conversation starts | Load customer context |
| **Mid-Call** | During conversation | Check status, take action |
| **Post-Call** | After conversation ends | Log to CRM, create tickets |

---

## Configuration

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **URL** | API endpoint |
| **Method** | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE |
| **Headers** | Authorization, Content-Type |
| **Body** | Request payload (JSON) |
| **Response Mapping** | Extract data to variables |

---

## Example

**Request:**
```
GET https://api.example.com/customers/{{caller_phone}}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "name": "Jane Smith",
  "tier": "premium"
}
```

**Use in prompt:**
```
Hello {{customer_name}}! I see you're a {{tier}} member.
```

## Implementation

API calls are configured differently in each agent type.
