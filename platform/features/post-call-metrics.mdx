Post-call metrics let you pull specific insights from conversations after they end. Define what you want to know — satisfaction scores, call outcomes, issue categories — and Atoms analyzes each call to fill in the answers.

**Location:** Left Sidebar → Post Call Metrics

## How It Works

1. **You define metrics** — What questions do you want answered about each call?
2. **Call ends** — Conversation completes normally
3. **AI analyzes** — Atoms reviews the transcript against your metrics
4. **Data populated** — Your metrics get filled in automatically
5. **Access anywhere** — View in logs, receive via webhook, export

## Creating a New Metric

Click the **Add Metrics +** button to open the configuration panel. You'll see two options:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Disposition Metrics">
    <Frame caption="Create a new metric from scratch">
      ![Disposition metrics](/platform/building-agents/images/post-call-disposition.png)
    </Frame>
    
    Build a custom metric from scratch. Fill in the Identifier, Data Type, and Prompt — see details below.
    
    Use **Add Another +** to create multiple metrics at once.
    
    <Note>
    Don't forget to hit **Save** in the Disposition tab once you're done.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Templates">
    <Frame caption="Select from pre-built metrics">
      ![Metric templates](/platform/building-agents/images/post-call-templates.png)
    </Frame>
    
    Choose from pre-built metrics for common use cases. Just select the ones you want — no manual configuration needed.

## Configuring a Metric

Each metric needs three things:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Identifier** | Yes | Unique name for this metric. Lowercase, numbers, underscores only. |
| **Data Type** | Yes | What kind of value: String, Number, or Boolean |
| **Prompt** | Yes | The question you want answered about the call |

### Identifier

This is the key used to reference the metric in exports, webhooks, and the API.

```
customer_satisfaction
call_outcome
follow_up_needed
```

<Note>
**Naming rules:** Lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores only. No spaces or special characters.
</Note>

### Data Type

| Type | Use for | Example values |
|------|---------|----------------|
| **String** | Free text, categories | "resolved", "escalated", "billing issue" |
| **Boolean** | Yes/no questions | true, false |
| **Integer** | Whole numbers, scores | 1, 5, 10 |
| **Enum** | Fixed set of options | One of: "low", "medium", "high" |
| **Datetime** | Dates and times | "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z" |

### Prompt

This is the question the AI answers by analyzing the transcript. Be specific.

**Good prompts:**
- "Did the agent acknowledge and respond to customer concerns effectively?"
- "Rate customer satisfaction from 1 to 5 based on tone and words used."
- "What was the primary reason for this call? Options: billing, technical, account, other"

**Vague prompts to avoid:**
- "Was it good?"
- "Customer happy?"

<Tip>
**Start with 3-5 metrics.** Too many can slow analysis and clutter your data. Add more as you learn what insights matter most.
</Tip>
