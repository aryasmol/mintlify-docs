## Using System Variables

### In Prompts

```
You are a support agent. The caller's phone number is {{caller_phone}}.

When ending the call, say: "This call started at {{call_start_time}} 
and your reference number is {{call_id}}."
```

### In API Calls

```json
{
  "phone": "{{caller_phone}}",
  "call_id": "{{call_id}}",
  "timestamp": "{{call_start_time}}"
}
```

### In Webhooks

System variables are automatically included in webhook payloads for call events.

## Common Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Caller ID Lookup" icon="search">
    Use `{{caller_phone}}` in a Pre-Call API to fetch customer data:
    
    ```
    GET https://api.yourcrm.com/customers?phone={{caller_phone}}
    ```
    
    Response populates user variables like `{{customer_name}}`.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Call Reference Numbers" icon="hashtag">
    Give callers a reference number for follow-up:
    
    ```
    "Your reference number for this call is {{call_id}}. 
    Please save this in case you need to follow up."
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Time-Based Greetings" icon="clock">
    While you can't do complex logic with variables alone, you can reference time:
    
    ```
    "Thanks for calling at {{current_time}}. 
    Let me check our current availability..."
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Post-Call Logging" icon="list">
    Include call data in your Post-Call API:

      "caller": "{{caller_phone}}",
