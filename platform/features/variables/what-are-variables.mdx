**Variables** let you inject dynamic information into your agent's conversations. Instead of generic responses, your agent can greet callers by name, reference their account details, and personalize the entire experience.

## Why Use Variables?

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Without Variables">
    ```
    Agent: "Hi, thanks for calling. How can I help you today?"
    
    Agent: "I see you have an appointment scheduled. 
           Would you like to confirm it?"
    ```
    
    Generic, impersonal, missing key details.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="With Variables">
    ```
    Agent: "Hi Sarah, thanks for calling Acme Support. 
           How can I help you today?"
    
    Agent: "I see you have an appointment on Tuesday at 2pm 
           with Dr. Johnson. Would you like to confirm it?"
    ```
    
    Personal, specific, builds trust immediately.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Variable Syntax

Use double curly braces to insert variables:

```
Hi {{customer_name}}, thanks for calling!

Your appointment is scheduled for {{appointment_date}} at {{appointment_time}}.

Your account balance is {{account_balance}}.
```

<Info>
Variable names are case-sensitive. `{{Customer_Name}}` and `{{customer_name}}` are different.
</Info>

## Two Types of Variables

Atoms has two categories of variables:

| Type | What It Is | Where It Comes From |
|------|------------|---------------------|
| **System Variables** | Automatic call data | Atoms provides these |
| **User Variables** | Your custom data | You define and populate these |

    Caller ID, timestamp, call duration, etc.
  </Card>
  <Card title="User Variables" icon="user" href="/platform/features/variables/user-variables">
    Customer name, account info, custom data
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Where Can You Use Variables?

Variables work in:

| Location | Example Use |
|----------|-------------|
| **Agent prompts** | "Greet the caller by {{customer_name}}" |
| **Node prompts** (Convo Flow) | "Your balance is {{account_balance}}" |
| **API call bodies** | `{"phone": "{{caller_phone}}"}` |
| **Webhook payloads** | Include call data in notifications |

---

## How Variables Get Their Values

<Steps>
  ### System Variables
  
  Populated automatically by Atoms when the call connects:
  - `{{caller_phone}}` — The caller's phone number
  - `{{call_start_time}}` — When the call began
  - `{{agent_name}}` — Your agent's name

  ### User Variables (Outbound Calls)
  
  When making outbound calls via campaigns, you provide the data:
  - Upload a CSV with customer info
  - Each row populates variables for that call
  - `{{customer_name}}`, `{{appointment_date}}`, etc.

  ### User Variables (Inbound Calls)
  
  For inbound calls, populate variables via:
  - **Pre-Call API** — Fetch data based on caller ID
  - **During the call** — Collect and store what the caller says
  - **Integrations** — Pull from CRM based on phone number
</Steps>

## Quick Example

**Prompt using variables:**
```
You are a scheduling assistant for Premier Dental.

When the call connects, greet the caller: 
"Hi {{customer_name}}, this is a reminder about your 
appointment on {{appointment_date}} at {{appointment_time}} 
with {{provider_name}}."

Ask if they'd like to confirm, reschedule, or cancel.
```

**For a call where:**
- `customer_name` = "Sarah"
- `appointment_date` = "Tuesday, January 21st"
- `appointment_time` = "2:00 PM"
- `provider_name` = "Dr. Johnson"

**Agent says:**
```
"Hi Sarah, this is a reminder about your appointment on 
Tuesday, January 21st at 2:00 PM with Dr. Johnson. 
Would you like to confirm, reschedule, or cancel?"
```
