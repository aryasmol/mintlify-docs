A Knowledge Base is a repository of documents and information that your agent can search during conversations. Instead of stuffing everything into a prompt, you upload content and let the agent retrieve what's relevant when needed.

**Location:** Left Sidebar → Knowledge Base

## Your Knowledge Bases

The Knowledge Base page shows all your KBs on the left. Click any KB to see its documents on the right.

</Frame>

Each document shows its status — **completed** means it's ready for your agent to use.

| Option | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Upload File** | Upload PDFs and documents directly |
| **Extract from URL** | Pull content from a website by analyzing its sitemap |

After uploading, documents are processed and indexed. Wait for **completed** status before expecting the agent to find the content.

## Connecting to Your Agent

Once you have a Knowledge Base with content:

1. Open your agent in the editor

## Tips

<Accordion title="Keep content current">
  Outdated information leads to wrong answers. Review and update regularly — especially policies, pricing, and procedures.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Structure for search">
  Use clear headings and concise paragraphs. Q&A format works well because it matches how callers actually ask questions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Quality over quantity">
  Focused, relevant content retrieves better than massive document dumps. Don't upload everything — upload what matters.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Test after uploading">
  Ask your agent questions that should use the new content. Verify it finds and uses the right information.
</Accordion>
