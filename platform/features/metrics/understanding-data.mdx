Collecting metrics is just the start. Here's how to interpret your data and use it to improve your agents and business outcomes.

## Key Metrics to Track

### Call Efficiency

| Metric | What It Tells You | Good Benchmark |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Average Duration** | How long calls take | Depends on use case |
| **First Call Resolution** | % resolved without follow-up | > 70% |
| **Transfer Rate** | % escalated to humans | < 20% |
| **Containment Rate** | % handled entirely by AI | > 80% |

### Customer Experience

| Metric | What It Tells You | Good Benchmark |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Sentiment** | How callers feel | > 60% positive |
| **Satisfaction** | Implied CSAT | > 4.0 / 5 |
| **Resolution Rate** | Issues actually solved | > 80% |

### Business Outcomes

| Metric | What It Tells You | Good Benchmark |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Conversion Rate** | Leads → customers | Varies by industry |
| **Booking Rate** | Calls → appointments | > 60% for booking agents |
| **Lead Quality** | % qualified leads | > 40% |

## Interpreting Common Patterns

### Pattern: High Transfer Rate

```
Transfer Rate: 35% (above 20% target)
```

**What it might mean:**
- Agent can't handle certain issue types
- Knowledge base missing information
- Callers requesting human explicitly
- Complex issues beyond AI capability

**Actions:**
1. Review transferred call transcripts
2. Identify common transfer reasons
3. Update KB or prompts to address gaps
4. Consider if some transfers are appropriate

---

### Pattern: Declining Sentiment

```
Week 1: 72% Positive → Week 4: 54% Positive
```

**What it might mean:**
- Product/service issues affecting customers
- Agent responses frustrating callers
- Wait times or call quality issues
- External factors (outages, recalls)

**Actions:**
1. Review recent negative calls
2. Look for common complaints
3. Check for prompt/KB changes
4. Coordinate with product/service teams

---

### Pattern: Long Average Duration

```
Average Duration: 8m 32s (vs. 4m target)
```

**What it might mean:**
- Complex issues requiring more discussion
- Agent going off-topic
- Callers asking many follow-up questions
- Slow API responses causing delays

**Actions:**
1. Review longest calls
2. Check for unnecessary conversation loops
3. Ensure agent is efficient
4. Verify API response times

---

### Pattern: Low Resolution Rate

```
Resolution Rate: 45% (target: 70%)
```

**What it might mean:**
- Knowledge base lacking information
- Issues requiring human intervention
- Agent not understanding requests
- Wrong disposition classification

**Actions:**
1. Review "unresolved" calls
2. Categorize by issue type
3. Add missing KB content
4. Improve agent prompts

## Segment Analysis

Don't just look at overall numbers — segment your data.

### By Issue Type

| Issue Type | Volume | Resolution | Sentiment |
|------------|--------|------------|-----------|
| Billing | 234 | 82% | 71% pos |
| Technical | 189 | 45% | 52% pos |
| Account | 156 | 91% | 78% pos |
| Product | 98 | 73% | 65% pos |

**Insight:** Technical issues have low resolution and sentiment → Focus improvement there.

### By Time of Day

| Time | Volume | Avg Duration | Transfer Rate |
|------|--------|--------------|---------------|
| 9am-12pm | 342 | 3m 45s | 12% |
| 12pm-5pm | 456 | 4m 12s | 18% |
| 5pm-9pm | 234 | 5m 30s | 28% |
| After hours | 89 | 2m 15s | 8% |

**Insight:** Evening calls have higher transfer rates → Perhaps more complex issues or staffing needed.

### By Customer Segment

| Segment | Volume | Satisfaction | Resolution |
|---------|--------|--------------|------------|
| New | 287 | 3.8 | 72% |
| Regular | 456 | 4.2 | 85% |
| VIP | 78 | 4.5 | 92% |

**Insight:** New customers need more support → Enhance onboarding-related responses.

## Setting Benchmarks

### Start with Baselines

Before optimizing, establish where you are:

1. Run agents for 2-4 weeks
2. Collect baseline metrics
3. Set realistic targets based on baselines
4. Improve incrementally

### Industry Benchmarks

| Metric | Contact Centers | Voice AI (Realistic) |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Average Handle Time | 6 min | 4-5 min |
| First Call Resolution | 70-75% | 65-80% |
| Transfer Rate | 15-20% | 15-25% |
| CSAT | 4.0/5 | 3.8-4.2/5 |

### Progressive Goals

Set targets that improve over time:

| Metric | Baseline | 30 Days | 90 Days |
|--------|----------|---------|---------|
| Resolution | 65% | 70% | 80% |
| Sentiment | 58% pos | 62% pos | 70% pos |
| Transfer | 28% | 24% | 18% |

---

## Taking Action

### Metric → Insight → Action Framework

```
Metric: Resolution rate dropped 10%
     ↓
Insight: New product launch causing unknown questions
     ↓
Action: Upload new product documentation to KB
     ↓
Measure: Track resolution rate for product questions
```

### Prioritization Matrix

| Impact | Effort | Priority |
|--------|--------|----------|
| High resolution impact | Low effort | **Do First** |
| High impact | High effort | Plan carefully |
| Low impact | Low effort | Quick wins |
| Low impact | High effort | Skip or defer |
