Based on the caller's tone and statements, estimate their 
satisfaction level from 1 to 5:

2 - Dissatisfied (frustrated, unhappy with resolution)
3 - Neutral (matter-of-fact, no strong feelings expressed)

Respond with just the number.
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Specific in Prompts" icon="bullseye">
    Vague prompts → inconsistent results
    
    **Bad:**
    ```
    What's the lead status?
    ```
    
    **Good:**
    ```
    Based on the conversation, classify the lead status:
    - HOT: Strong buying signals, has budget, immediate need
    - WARM: Interested but not urgent, may need nurturing
    - COLD: Low interest, just researching
    - NOT QUALIFIED: Wrong fit or no decision authority
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Define Clear Categories" icon="list">
    For categorical metrics:
    - Use distinct, non-overlapping options
    - Define what each option means
    - Limit to 5-7 options max
    
    **Too many options:**
    ```
    Very Hot, Hot, Somewhat Hot, Warm, Lukewarm, 
    Cool, Cold, Very Cold, Frozen, Not Qualified
    ```
    
    **Just right:**
    ```
    Hot, Warm, Cold, Not Qualified
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Include Edge Cases" icon="question">
    Tell the AI what to do when things are unclear:
    
    ```
    If the sentiment cannot be determined (call too short, 
    no clear indicators), respond with "Neutral"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test with Real Calls" icon="flask">
    After creating a metric:
    1. Process a few test calls
    2. Review the extracted values
    3. Adjust the prompt if needed
    4. Repeat until accurate
