**Post Call Metrics** let you automatically extract and track specific data points from every conversation. Instead of manually reviewing calls, define what you want to measure and Atoms extracts it for you.

## Why Use Post Call Metrics?

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Without Metrics">
    To understand your calls, you have to:
    - Listen to recordings manually
    - Read through transcripts
    - Manually categorize outcomes
    - Build reports by hand
    
    This doesn't scale.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="With Metrics">
    Atoms automatically:
    - Extracts key data from every call
    - Categorizes outcomes consistently
    - Tracks trends over time
    - Provides instant analytics
    
    Zero manual work.
  </Tab>

## How It Works

After every call:

```
[Call Ends]
     ↓
[AI Analyzes Transcript]
     ↓
[Extracts Defined Metrics]
     ↓
[Stores for Analytics]
     ↓
[Available in Dashboard & API]
```

The AI reviews the entire conversation and extracts the metrics you've defined — no manual tagging required.
