A well-structured Knowledge Base improves agent accuracy. A poorly organized one can make things worse. Follow these best practices to get the most from your KB.

## Content Structure

### Use Clear Headings

Break content into sections with descriptive headings. The agent can better find relevant sections.

| Bad | Good |
|-----|------|
| Long paragraphs with no structure | ### Return Policy<br/>### Shipping Times<br/>### Refunds |

### Write in Q&A Format

Question-answer format matches how callers actually ask:

```
Q: How long do I have to return an item?
A: You have 30 days from purchase to return any item in original packaging.

Q: Can I return opened items?
A: Opened items can be returned if defective. For non-defective items, 
   a 15% restocking fee applies.
```

### Be Concise

Long, rambling text reduces retrieval accuracy. Be direct:

| Bad | Good |
|-----|------|
| "In many cases, customers often wonder about our various return policies which have been developed over many years..." | "Return window: 30 days from purchase. Items must be in original packaging." |

## Content Quality

### Keep Information Current

| Action | Frequency |
|--------|-----------|
| Review for accuracy | Monthly |
| Update changed policies | Immediately |
| Remove obsolete content | As needed |

Outdated information leads to wrong answers and frustrated callers.

### Prioritize Accuracy

Everything in your KB should be 100% correct. Agents will cite it confidently.

### Include Edge Cases

Don't just cover the happy path:

```
Q: What if I lost my receipt?
A: We can look up your purchase using your credit card or loyalty account. 
   If neither is available, we offer store credit at current price.
```

## Organization

### Use Logical Categories

Group related information:

```
Product Information/
├── Product X/
│   ├── Features
│   ├── Specifications
│   └── Troubleshooting
├── Product Y/
│   ├── Features
│   └── Specifications
└── Product Comparison
```

### Avoid Duplication

Same information in multiple places causes confusion:
- Which version is current?
- Which will the agent find?

One source of truth is better.

### Name Files Descriptively

| Bad | Good |
|-----|------|
| doc1.pdf | Product_X_User_Guide_2024.pdf |
| info.txt | Shipping_Rates_and_Zones.txt |

---

## Retrieval Optimization

### Use Keywords Callers Use

Write content using the same words callers would say:

| Technical | Caller Language |
|-----------|-----------------|
| "authentication failure" | "can't log in" |
| "remittance processing" | "payment" |
| "merchandise return" | "give back item" |

Include both when possible.

### Test Retrieval

After uploading:

1. Ask questions as callers would
2. Check if the right content is retrieved
3. Adjust content wording if not

### Don't Over-Stuff

Too much content can hurt:
- Retrieval becomes less precise
- Irrelevant content may surface
- Agent responses become confused

Focus on information callers actually need.

## Maintenance

### Regular Audits

Schedule periodic reviews:
- Is content still accurate?
- Are there gaps?
- Is anything unused?

### Version Control

When updating important documents:
- Note what changed
- Consider dating versions
- Archive old versions if needed

### Monitor Conversations

Review conversation logs to identify:
- Questions KB couldn't answer
- Wrong information surfaced
- Content gaps to fill
