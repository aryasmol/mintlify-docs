After uploading documents, you need to connect the knowledge base to your agent. Here's how to set it up and get the most out of it.

## Connecting a Knowledge Base

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="During Agent Creation">
    When creating a new agent:
    
    1. Scroll to the **Knowledge Base** section
    2. Click **Select Knowledge Base**
    3. Choose from your existing knowledge bases
    4. Continue with agent creation
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="To an Existing Agent">
    For agents you've already created:
    
    1. Open your agent in the editor
    2. Look for **Knowledge Base** in the right panel
    3. Click **Select** or **Change**
    4. Choose the knowledge base you want

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## How Retrieval Works

When a caller asks a question:

```
Caller: "What's your return policy?"
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. Question → Search Query     │
│  2. Search Knowledge Base       │
│  3. Retrieve Top 3-5 Chunks     │
│  4. Inject into Agent Context   │
│  5. Generate Response           │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
         │
         ▼
Agent: "You can return any item within 30 days 
        for a full refund. Would you like me to 
        start a return for you?"
```

<Info>
The agent doesn't read your entire knowledge base for every question — it retrieves only the most relevant sections, making responses fast and focused.

## Best Practices

### Write Prompts That Use the Knowledge Base

Your prompt should tell the agent *when* and *how* to use the knowledge base:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="❌ Without KB Instructions">
    ```
    You are a customer support agent. Help customers 
    with their questions.
    ```
    
    Agent might not prioritize KB content.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="✅ With KB Instructions">
    ```
    You are a customer support agent. When customers ask 
    about products, policies, or procedures, refer to the 
    knowledge base for accurate information.
    
    If you can't find the answer in the knowledge base, 
    say "I don't have that information, but I can connect 
    you with someone who does."
    ```
    
    Agent knows to check KB and how to handle missing info.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Match KB Content to Use Case

| Agent Type | What to Include in KB |
|------------|----------------------|
| **Customer Support** | FAQs, troubleshooting guides, policies |
| **Sales** | Product specs, pricing, case studies |
| **Booking** | Service descriptions, provider info |
| **Collections** | Account lookup procedures, payment options |

### Keep Content Current

- **Review monthly:** Remove outdated information
- **Update after changes:** New pricing? New policies? Update the KB
- **Test regularly:** Call your agent and ask about recently updated content

---

## One Agent, Multiple Knowledge Bases?

Currently, each agent connects to **one knowledge base** at a time. 

<Accordion title="Workaround: Combine Documents">
  If you need information from multiple sources:
  
  1. Create a single knowledge base for that agent
  2. Upload all relevant documents to it
  3. Use clear naming to organize (e.g., `support-faq.pdf`, `product-specs.pdf`)
</Accordion>

---

## Testing KB Retrieval

After connecting, test that your agent actually uses the knowledge base:

<Steps>
  ### Ask a KB-Specific Question
  
  Ask something that's *only* in your knowledge base, not general knowledge:
  - "What's your return policy?" (specific to your company)
  - "How much does [specific product] cost?"
  - "What are your business hours?"

  ### Check the Response
  
  The answer should match your uploaded documents. If it doesn't:
  - Verify the document uploaded successfully
  - Check that the KB is connected to this agent
  - Look at the document content — is the answer actually there?

  ### Review Call Logs
  
  In **Conversation Logs**, you can see if the agent retrieved KB content and what it found.
</Steps>

## Common Issues

| Problem | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Agent doesn't use KB | KB not connected | Check agent settings |
| Wrong information | Outdated document | Update or replace the file |
| "I don't know" for KB content | Content not found | Check document formatting, try rephrasing |
| Generic answers | Prompt doesn't reference KB | Add KB instructions to prompt |
