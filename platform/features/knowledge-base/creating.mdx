## Naming Best Practices

Choose clear, descriptive names:

| Good Names | Why |
|------------|-----|
| "Product Support FAQ" | Clear purpose |
| "Shipping Policies v2" | Includes version |
| "TechCorp Returns" | Company + topic |

| Avoid | Why |
|-------|-----|
| "KB1" | Not descriptive |
| "Stuff" | Too vague |
| "New knowledge base" | Default-sounding |

## Local vs Global

Choose during creation:

| Type | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| **Local** | Information specific to one agent |
| **Global** | Information multiple agents should share |

## After Creation

Your Knowledge Base is created but empty. Next steps:

1. **Upload content** — Add documents and information
2. **Wait for processing** — System indexes content
3. **Attach to agent** — Connect in agent's Configuration Panel
4. **Test** — Verify retrieval works
