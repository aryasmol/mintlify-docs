## Uploading Documents

### Step 1: Open Your KB

Navigate to your Knowledge Base from the Build menu.

### Step 2: Click Upload

Click the **"Upload"** or **"Add Content"** button.

### Step 3: Select Files

Choose files from your computer.

### Step 4: Wait for Processing

Files are:
1. Uploaded to Atoms
2. Parsed (text extracted)
3. Indexed for search
4. Ready for use

Processing time depends on file size and complexity.

## Adding Text Directly

For quick additions without creating a file:

1. Click **"Add Text"** or similar
2. Paste or type your content
3. Save

Good for:
- Individual FAQ entries
- Quick policy updates
- Short information snippets

---

## Adding URLs

To include web content:

1. Click **"Add URL"**
2. Enter the web address
3. Atoms crawls the page
4. Content is extracted and indexed

**Notes:**
- Some pages may not crawl due to access restrictions
- Dynamic content may not be captured
- Re-crawl periodically for fresh content

## Content Best Practices

### Structure for Searchability

| Good | Bad |
|------|-----|
| Clear headings | Wall of text |
| Question-answer format | Rambling prose |
| Concise paragraphs | Endless sentences |
| Specific topics | Everything mixed together |

### Keep Content Current

Outdated content leads to wrong answers. Review and update regularly.

### Don't Over-Upload

Quality over quantity. Focused, relevant content retrieves better than massive dumps.

### Test After Uploading

Ask questions that should use new content. Verify the agent finds and uses it correctly.

---

## Processing Status

After uploading, content goes through processing:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Processing** | Being indexed |
| **Ready** | Available for retrieval |
| **Error** | Processing failed |

Wait for "Ready" status before expecting content to be found.
