Knowledge Bases can be scoped to a single agent (Local) or shared across multiple agents (Global). Choosing the right scope helps you organize information effectively.

---

## Comparison

| Aspect | Local KB | Global KB |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Scope** | One agent only | Multiple agents |
| **Visibility** | Attached agent | All agents you assign |
| **Use case** | Agent-specific info | Company-wide knowledge |
| **Management** | Per-agent | Centralized |

---

## Local Knowledge Base

A Local KB is attached to and used by only one agent.

### When to Use

- Information specific to one agent's purpose
- Content that would confuse other agents
- Specialized product or service details
- Agent-specific policies

### Example

**Product Support Agent** has a Local KB with:
- Technical specifications for Product X
- Troubleshooting guides for Product X
- Product X-specific FAQs

Other agents don't need (and shouldn't have) this specialized information.

---

## Global Knowledge Base

A Global KB is shared across multiple agents.

### When to Use

- Company-wide policies
- General FAQs that apply everywhere
- Brand guidelines
- Universal processes

### Example

**Shared Company KB** contains:
- Return policy
- Shipping information
- Company hours and locations
- General FAQ

Multiple agents (Sales, Support, Billing) all reference this shared knowledge.

## Best Practices

### Use Global for Common Knowledge

If multiple agents need the same information, make it Global:
- One source of truth
- Update once, applies everywhere
- Consistent answers across agents

### Use Local for Specialized Knowledge

If only one agent needs specific information, keep it Local:
- Cleaner retrieval (less noise)
- No confusion with irrelevant content
- Agent-specific accuracy

### Combine Both

Many setups use both:

```
Agent: Product X Support
├── Global KB: Company Policies
└── Local KB: Product X Documentation

Agent: Product Y Support  
├── Global KB: Company Policies (same)
└── Local KB: Product Y Documentation
```

Both agents share policies but have their own product docs.

## Managing Multiple KBs

As you add agents and knowledge bases:

1. **Audit regularly** — Is content still in the right place?
2. **Avoid duplication** — Same content shouldn't be in multiple KBs
3. **Name clearly** — "Global - Company Policies" vs "Local - Product X"
4. **Document your structure** — Know which KB serves which purpose
