A Knowledge Base is a repository of documents, FAQs, and information that your agent can search and reference during conversations. Instead of trying to stuff everything into a prompt, you upload content and let the agent retrieve relevant information when needed.

---

## Why Use Knowledge Base

### More Accurate Answers

Agents can cite actual documents rather than guessing or hallucinating.

### Easy Updates

Change a policy? Update the document. No prompt editing needed.

### Scalable Knowledge

Add hundreds of pages of content that would never fit in a prompt.

### Reduced Prompt Complexity

Keep your prompt focused on behavior. Let the KB handle information.

## How It Works

1. **You upload content** — Documents, text, URLs
2. **Atoms processes it** — Content is indexed for search
3. **Caller asks a question** — Agent receives the query
4. **Agent searches KB** — Finds relevant sections
5. **Agent responds** — Uses KB content in the answer

## What You Can Upload

| Content Type | Examples |
|--------------|----------|
| **Documents** | PDFs, Word docs, text files |
| **Text** | Directly pasted content |
| **URLs** | Web pages to crawl |
| **FAQ lists** | Question-answer pairs |

## Local vs Global

| Type | Scope | Use Case |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Local KB** | Single agent | Agent-specific information |
| **Global KB** | Multiple agents | Shared company knowledge |

**Example:**
- Global KB: Company policies, general FAQ
- Local KB: Product-specific details for a product support agent
