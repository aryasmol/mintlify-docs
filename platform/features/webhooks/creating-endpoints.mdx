Before you can receive webhooks, you need to create endpoint configurations in Atoms. This page walks you through the process.

---

## What You Need

Before starting:

1. **A URL that can receive POST requests** — Your server endpoint
2. **HTTPS** — Required for security
3. **200 OK response** — Endpoint must acknowledge receipt

---

## Creating an Endpoint

→ **NEEDS PLATFORM INFO:** Detailed endpoint creation interface

### Step 1: Navigate to Webhooks

In your Atoms dashboard, find the Webhooks section.

### Step 2: Click Create

Click **"Create Endpoint"** or **"Add Webhook"**.

### Step 3: Configure Endpoint

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Name** | Descriptive label | "CRM Integration" |
| **URL** | Your endpoint URL | https://api.yoursite.com/webhooks/atoms |
| **Secret** | (Optional) Signing secret | For payload verification |

### Step 4: Save

Save the endpoint configuration.

## Endpoint Requirements

### HTTPS Required

Your endpoint must use HTTPS. HTTP endpoints are not supported for security.

### Respond with 200

Your endpoint must return HTTP 200 to acknowledge receipt:

```javascript
// Example Node.js endpoint
app.post('/webhooks/atoms', (req, res) => {
  const payload = req.body;
  
  // Process the webhook...
  processWebhook(payload);
  
  // Acknowledge receipt
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```

### Timeout Handling

Atoms waits a limited time for response. If your processing takes long:
1. Acknowledge immediately
2. Process asynchronously

---

## Signing and Verification

To verify webhooks are actually from Atoms:

1. Set a **Secret** when creating the endpoint
2. Atoms signs payloads with this secret
3. Your endpoint verifies the signature

→ **NEEDS PLATFORM INFO:** Signature verification details

---

## Testing Your Endpoint

### Before Connecting

1. Create your endpoint on your server
2. Test it can receive POST requests
3. Verify it returns 200

### After Creating in Atoms

1. Assign endpoint to an agent (Webhook Tab)
2. Select events to subscribe
3. Make a test call
4. Check your endpoint received the data

---

## Multiple Endpoints

You can create multiple endpoints for different purposes:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| CRM Integration | Send to Salesforce |
| Analytics | Send to data warehouse |
| Notifications | Trigger Slack alerts |

Assign different endpoints to different agents as needed.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Not receiving webhooks | Verify endpoint URL, check firewall |
| Getting 401/403 | Check authentication requirements |
| Timeout errors | Process async, respond quickly |
| Missing data | Verify correct events subscribed |
