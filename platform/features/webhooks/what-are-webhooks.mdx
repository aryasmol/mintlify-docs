Webhooks are HTTP callbacks that notify your systems when something happens in Atoms. When a call starts, ends, or analytics complete, Atoms sends data to your specified URL.

---

## How Webhooks Work

1. **Event occurs** — A call starts, ends, or analytics finish
2. **Atoms sends POST** — HTTP request to your endpoint
3. **Your system receives** — Payload with event data
4. **You process it** — Log, update CRM, trigger workflows

---

## Why Use Webhooks

- Don't poll for updates

### Integration

## Available Events

When call ends:
1. Webhook sends transcript and outcome
2. Your endpoint creates/updates contact record
3. Notes are added to the contact
4. Tasks are created for follow-up

### Real-Time Dashboard

When call starts:
1. Webhook notifies your system
2. Dashboard shows active call
3. Live stats update

When call ends:
4. Dashboard updates completion stats
5. Metrics recalculate

### Email Follow-Up

When analytics complete:
1. Webhook sends satisfaction score
2. Your system evaluates score
3. Sends appropriate follow-up email
