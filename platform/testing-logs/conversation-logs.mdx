Conversation Logs provide a detailed record of every conversation your agent has. Use them to debug issues, understand caller behavior, and improve your agent over time.

---

## Location

**Top right → "Convo Logs" button**

---

## What's Included

Each conversation log contains:

| Data | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Full Transcript** | Every word spoken by caller and agent |
| **Timestamps** | When each message occurred |
| **Caller Information** | Phone number, call duration |
| **Outcome** | How the call ended (disposition) |
| **Variables** | Values at each stage |
| **Node Path** | (Convo Flow) Which nodes were visited |
| **Post-Call Metrics** | Extracted analysis data |

---

## Accessing Logs

1. Click **"Convo Logs"** button (top right of agent editor)
2. Browse list of conversations
3. Click any conversation to see details

## Using Logs for Debugging

| Issue | What to Look For |
|-------|------------------|
| **Wrong responses** | Check what caller said vs. agent understanding |
| **Unexpected end** | Review end call trigger and timing |
| **Transfer problems** | Verify transfer triggered at right moment |
| **Variable issues** | Check variable values throughout |
| **Branch mistakes** | (Convo Flow) See which condition matched |

### Example Debug Flow

1. Caller says call ended too early
2. Open conversation log for that call
3. Find the end point in transcript
4. Check what triggered end call
5. Adjust end call conditions or prompt
6. Test again

## Filtering and Searching

Find specific conversations by:

| Filter | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| **Date range** | Last 24 hours, last week, custom |
| **Duration** | Short calls, long calls |
| **Outcome** | Successful, unsuccessful, transferred |
| **Caller** | Specific phone number |
| **Search** | Keywords in transcript |

## Analyzing Patterns

Review logs regularly to identify:

### Common Questions

What do callers frequently ask? Add to your prompt or knowledge base.

### Failure Points

Where do conversations break down? Improve handling for those scenarios.

### Unexpected Topics

Are callers asking about things you didn't anticipate? Expand coverage.

### Successful Patterns

What makes good conversations work? Reinforce those approaches.

## Conversation Log Details

When you open a specific conversation:

### Transcript View

Full conversation with:
- Caller messages
- Agent responses
- Timestamps
- Turn indicators

### Variable Tracking

See how variables changed:
```
{{customer_name}} → set to "John Smith" (Pre-Call API)
{{issue_type}} → set to "billing" (from conversation)
{{resolved}} → set to "true" (agent determined)
```

### Node Path (Convo Flow)

Visual or list showing:
```
Start → Greeting → Issue Type → Billing Help → Resolution → End Call
```

Helps identify if conversation took expected path.

## Best Practices

### Review Regularly

Don't wait for complaints. Proactively review logs to catch issues early.

### Sample Across Scenarios

Look at:
- Successful calls
- Failed calls
- Long calls
- Short calls
- Different times of day

### Take Notes

Document patterns you find. Create a list of improvements to make.

### Close the Loop

After making changes, review new conversations to verify improvements.
