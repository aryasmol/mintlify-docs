Locking protects your agent from unintended changes. Once locked, no edits can be made until you explicitly unlock. This is essential for production agents handling real calls.

## Location

**Top right → "Lock Agent" toggle**

## Why Lock Agents

### Protect Production

A typo in a prompt could affect thousands of calls. Locking prevents accidental changes.

### Team Safety

Multiple team members can view a locked agent without risk of conflicting edits.

### Version Stability

Lock agents to preserve a working version before experimenting with changes.

### Deployment Confidence

Know exactly what configuration is handling calls — it can't change unexpectedly.

---

## How to Lock

1. Finish configuring your agent
2. Test thoroughly
3. Toggle **"Lock Agent"** to ON
4. Agent is now locked

---

## What Happens When Locked

| Feature | Locked State |
|---------|--------------|
| Edit prompt | ❌ Disabled |
| Change voice/model | ❌ Disabled |
| Modify configuration | ❌ Disabled |
| Test Agent | ✅ Still works |
| View Convo Logs | ✅ Still works |
| Make/receive calls | ✅ Still works |

Testing is still available — it doesn't change the agent configuration.

## How to Unlock

1. Toggle **"Lock Agent"** to OFF
2. Make your changes
3. Test the changes
4. Lock again when done

---

## Best Practices

### Lock Production Agents

Any agent handling real customer calls should be locked.

### Unlock → Change → Test → Lock

Follow this cycle:
1. Unlock the agent
2. Make your changes
3. Test thoroughly
4. Lock again

### Communicate with Team

If multiple people work on agents, communicate before unlocking:
- "I'm unlocking Agent X to make prompt changes"
- "Done — Agent X is locked again"

### Don't Leave Unlocked

After making changes, always lock again. An unlocked production agent is a risk.

## Locked vs Unlocked Indicators

The interface clearly shows lock state:

| State | Visual |
|-------|--------|
| **Locked** | Toggle is ON, may show lock icon |
| **Unlocked** | Toggle is OFF, editable |

---

## When to Lock

| Scenario | Lock? |
|----------|-------|
| Active in production | ✅ Yes |
| Connected to phone number | ✅ Yes |
| Used in campaigns | ✅ Yes |
| Still developing | ❌ Not yet |
| Testing new changes | ❌ Not until ready |

---

## Version Control Alternative

For more sophisticated versioning:

1. **Clone the agent** — Create a copy for development
2. **Make changes to copy** — Experiment freely
3. **Test the copy** — Verify it works
4. **Replace production** — Swap when ready

This keeps your production agent locked at all times.
