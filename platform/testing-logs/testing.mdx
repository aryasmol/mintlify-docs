Testing is essential before deploying your agent. Atoms provides multiple testing modes so you can verify behavior across different scenarios.

## Location

**Top right → "Test Agent" button**

---

## Test Modes

| Mode | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Telephony Call** | Real phone call to your device | Full phone experience, final testing |
| **Web Call** | Browser voice call | Quick voice testing, iterating |
| **Chat** | Text conversation | Testing logic only, fast iteration |

---

## How to Test

1. Click **"Test Agent"** button (top right)
2. Select your testing mode
3. Start the test
4. Have a conversation as a real caller would
5. Try different scenarios and paths

## What to Test

### Prompt Understanding

| Test | What to Check |
|------|---------------|
| Does the agent understand your questions? | Correct interpretation |
| Are responses appropriate? | Relevant to what was asked |
| Does it follow your prompt instructions? | Behavioral alignment |

### Voice Quality

| Test | What to Check |
|------|---------------|
| Is speech clear? | No audio issues |
| Natural pacing? | Not too fast or slow |
| Correct pronunciation? | Especially for names/terms |
| Appropriate tone? | Matches intended personality |

### End Call Behavior

| Test | What to Check |
|------|---------------|
| Say goodbye | Does call end appropriately? |
| Confirm resolution | Does it end when satisfied? |
| Timeout | Does it handle silence correctly? |

### Transfer Behavior

| Test | What to Check |
|------|---------------|
| Request transfer | Does it trigger correctly? |
| Whisper message | Is context accurate? |
| Hold experience | Does music/message play? |

### Variables

| Test | What to Check |
|------|---------------|
| Are variables substituted? | `{{name}}` → actual name |
| Missing variables? | Graceful handling |

### Edge Cases

| Test | What to Check |
|------|---------------|
| Unexpected inputs | Graceful responses |
| Interruptions | Handles mid-sentence breaks |
| Confusion | Asks for clarification |
| Off-topic | Redirects appropriately |

### Conversational Flow (if applicable)

| Test | What to Check |
|------|---------------|
| Every branch | All paths work |
| All conditions | Correct routing |
| Dead ends | No stuck states |
| Loops | Don't trap callers |

## Testing Tips

### Test Like a Real Caller

Don't just test happy paths. Real callers will:
- Interrupt
- Say unexpected things
- Ask off-topic questions
- Be confused
- Speak unclearly

### Test All Three Modes

Each mode has different characteristics:
- **Chat** is fastest for logic testing
- **Web Call** adds voice layer
- **Telephony** is most realistic

### Use Conversation Logs

After each test, review the logs to see:
- Exact transcripts
- AI's interpretation
- Where things went wrong

### Iterate

1. Test
2. Find issues
3. Update prompt/config
4. Test again
5. Repeat

## Testing Conversational Flow Agents

For workflow-based agents, test every path:

```
Start → Path A → End ✓
Start → Path B → End ✓
Start → Path C → Path D → End ✓
Start → Path C → Path E → End ✓
Start → Fallback → Clarify → Path A ✓
```

Missing paths are invisible bugs until a real caller hits them.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before going live:

- [ ] Tested all happy paths
- [ ] Tested error handling
- [ ] Tested edge cases
- [ ] Tested with different voices/accents
- [ ] Verified end call triggers
- [ ] Verified transfer works
- [ ] Reviewed conversation logs
- [ ] Made final prompt adjustments
