A Single Prompt agent runs on one set of instructions. You write a prompt that defines who the agent is, what it knows, and how it should behave — and that prompt governs the entire conversation. The AI interprets your instructions and applies them dynamically, adapting to whatever direction the caller takes.

---

## When to Use

Single Prompt is ideal for **open-ended, flexible conversations** — customer support, general inquiries, FAQs. Choose it when you want natural dialogue that adapts to whatever direction the caller takes, rather than following a structured path.

For **structured, multi-step processes** like lead qualification, appointment booking, or intake forms, consider [Conversational Flow](/platform/convo-flow/overview) instead.

---

## How It Works

Think of your prompt as a briefing. You're telling the agent: here's your role, here's what you know, here's how to handle situations. The AI internalizes this once and then uses that understanding for every exchange.

When a caller speaks, the agent doesn't follow a script. It reasons through the conversation based on your instructions. This is why Single Prompt agents feel natural — they're not jumping between pre-written responses, they're thinking through each moment.

---

## Capabilities

**Dynamic tool usage.** You can connect your agent to APIs, databases, and external services. The agent decides when to use them based on the conversation. If a caller asks about their order, the agent can look it up. If they want to book something, it can check availability.

**Conversation memory.** Everything said in the call stays in context. The agent remembers details from earlier in the conversation and can reference them naturally.

**Handling the unexpected.** Without a rigid flow, the agent adapts to topic changes, follow-up questions, and tangents. Real conversations rarely follow a straight line — Single Prompt agents are designed for that reality.

## Building a Single Prompt Agent

You'll create three things:

**1. The Prompt**

This is the core. Your prompt should cover:
- **Identity** — Who is this agent? What's their name, role, personality?
- **Knowledge** — What do they know? Products, policies, FAQs, context.
- **Behavior** — How should they sound? What's off-limits? How do they handle edge cases?
- **Endings** — When should the call wrap up? When should they transfer?

**2. Tools** (optional)

If you want the agent to take actions — look up records, check calendars, create tickets — you'll configure the tools it can access and describe when to use them.

**3. Voice and Model**

Pick the voice your agent speaks with and the AI model that powers its reasoning.

## The Editor

Once you create a Single Prompt agent, you land in the editor — your workspace for everything.

## After You Launch

Once your agent is live, refinement happens in a few places:

**Prompt updates.** You'll review call logs, find where the agent struggled, and tighten your instructions. Most improvements come from prompt iteration.

**Voice tuning.** Adjust speech speed, add pronunciation rules for tricky words, tweak turn-taking behavior.

**Tool adjustments.** Add new capabilities, modify API connections, or change when tools get triggered.

**Configuration.** Fine-tune end call conditions, transfer settings, timeout behavior, and more.
