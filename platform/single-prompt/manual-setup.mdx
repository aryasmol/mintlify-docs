## What's Next

You're now in the editor. Here's where to go from here:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Write Your Prompt" icon="pen" href="/platform/single-prompt/writing-prompts">
    The heart of your agent — craft effective instructions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pick Your Model" icon="microchip" href="/platform/single-prompt/config/model-selection">
    Choose the LLM that powers your agent
  </Card>
  <Card title="Select a Voice" icon="waveform" href="/platform/single-prompt/config/voice-selection">
    Give your agent a voice that fits
  </Card>
  <Card title="Configure Features" icon="sliders" href="/platform/single-prompt/config/end-call">
    End call, transfer, knowledge base, and more
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
**First time?** Start by writing your prompt, picking a voice, and hitting **Test Agent** (top right). You can refine everything else as you go.
