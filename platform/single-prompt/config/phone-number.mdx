## Select Phone Numbers

Click the dropdown to choose from your available phone numbers. If you haven't set up any numbers yet, you'll see "No phone numbers selected."

You can assign multiple numbers to the same agent if needed.

<Note>
You need to purchase or configure phone numbers before they appear here. See [Phone Numbers](/platform/deployment/phone-numbers) to get started.
