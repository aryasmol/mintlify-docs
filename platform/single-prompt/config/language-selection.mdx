This sets the language your agent speaks by default. Simple as that.

**Location:** Prompt Section (top bar) → Language dropdown

---

## How It Works

Click the dropdown, pick your language. The options you see depend on which voice you've selected — different voices support different languages. If you don't see the language you need, try a different voice first.

<Tip>
**Need multi-language support?** If your agent should switch languages mid-conversation based on what the caller speaks, configure that in [Model Settings](/platform/single-prompt/config/model-settings).
