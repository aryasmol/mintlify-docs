Voice Settings give you precise control over how your agent sounds and listens. From speech speed to background ambiance, pronunciation rules to turn-taking — this is where you shape the audio experience.

## Voice

Select the voice for your agent. Click the dropdown to browse available voices — you can preview each one before selecting.

## Speech Settings

### Speech Speed

Control how fast your agent speaks.

| Control | Range | Default |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Slider | Slow ↔ Fast | 1 |

Slide left for a more measured, deliberate pace. Slide right for quicker delivery. Find the sweet spot that matches your use case — slower often works better for complex information, faster for simple confirmations.

## Pronunciation & Background

### Pronunciation Dictionaries

Add custom pronunciations for words that aren't pronounced correctly by the default voice.

This is especially useful for:
- Brand names
- Technical terms
- Proper nouns
- Industry-specific jargon

**To add a pronunciation:** Click **Add Pronunciation** to open the modal.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Word** | The word as written |
| **Pronunciation** | How it should sound |

### Background Sound

Add ambient audio behind your agent's voice for a more natural feel.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **None** | Silent background (default) |
| **Office** | Subtle office ambiance |
| **Call Center** | Busy call center sounds |
| **Static** | Light static noise |
| **Cafe** | Coffee shop atmosphere |

## Advanced Voice Settings

### Mute User Until First Bot Response

When enabled, the user's audio is muted until the agent's first response is complete. Useful for preventing early interruptions during the greeting.

### Voicemail Detection

Detects when a call goes to voicemail instead of reaching a live person.

<Warning>
Voicemail detection may not work as expected if **Release Time** is less than 0.6 seconds.
</Warning>

### Personal Info Redaction (PII)

Automatically redacts sensitive personal information from transcripts and logs.

### Denoising

Filters out background noise and improves voice clarity before processing. This helps reduce false detections caused by environmental sounds — useful when callers are in noisy environments.

---

## Voice Detection

Fine-tune how your agent recognizes when someone is speaking.

### Confidence

Defines how strict the system is when deciding if detected sound is speech. 

- **Higher values** → Less likely to trigger on background noise
- **Lower values** → More sensitive to quiet speech

| Default | Range |
|---------|-------|
| 0.70 | 0 – 1 |

### Min Volume

The minimum volume level required to register as speech.

| Default | Range |
|---------|-------|
| 0.60 | 0 – 1 |

### Trigger Time (Seconds)

How long the system waits after detecting the start of user speech (and after the bot has finished speaking) before processing. This helps avoid overlapping speech and false triggers.

| Default | Range |
|---------|-------|
| 0.10 | 0 – 1 |

### Release Time (Seconds)

How long the system waits after the user stops speaking before the bot begins its response. This ensures the user has completely finished their thought.

| Default | Range |
|---------|-------|
| 0.30 | 0 – 1+ |

<Tip>
**Start with defaults.** Only adjust these if you're experiencing specific issues like missed words or premature responses.
</Tip>

## Smart Turn Detection

Intelligent detection of when the caller is done speaking. When enabled, the agent uses context and speech patterns — not just silence — to determine when it's time to respond.

---

## Interruption Backoff Timer

Time in seconds to prevent interruptions after the bot starts speaking (default: 0, disabled).

This helps prevent conversation loops when the user and bot interrupt each other — the agent will wait this duration before allowing itself to be interrupted again.
