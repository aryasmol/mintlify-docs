## Transfer Types

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Cold Transfer">
    Immediate handoff. The caller connects directly to the destination without any briefing.
    
    | Pros | Cons |
    |------|------|
    | Fast | No context for receiving agent |
    | Simple | Caller may repeat themselves |
    
    **Best for:** Simple escalations, high call volume, when speed matters most.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Warm Transfer">
    AI briefs the human first. The receiving agent gets context before the caller joins.
    
    | Pros | Cons |
    |------|------|
    | Human has context | Slightly longer |
    | Better experience | More configuration |
    
    **Best for:** Complex issues, VIP callers, when continuity matters.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
