A Knowledge Base lets your agent search and retrieve information during conversations — product details, policies, FAQs, anything too detailed for the prompt itself.

**Location:** Configuration Panel (right sidebar) → Knowledge Base toggle

## Connecting a Knowledge Base

1. Toggle **Knowledge Base** ON
2. Select a KB from the dropdown

That's it. The agent automatically searches the KB when callers ask questions that need it.

<Tip>
You need to create a Knowledge Base first before you can attach it here.
