## The Four Prompts (Right Panel)

Each prompt helps AI understand a different aspect of your agent. All require at least 50 characters.

<Accordion title="1. Role & Objective">
  *Who is this agent and what's their goal?*
  
  **Tips:**
  - Be specific about the company/industry
  - Define the primary goal clearly
  - Include personality traits (friendly, professional, empathetic)
  - Mention what success looks like
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="2. Conversational Flow">
  *What steps should the agent follow?*
  
  **Tips:**
  - Think about the typical call from start to finish
  - Include verification steps if needed
  - Mention key decision points (what changes the path?)
  - End with how to close the conversation
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="3. Dos, Don'ts & Fallbacks">
  *How should the agent behave, especially in tricky situations?*
  
  **Tips:**
  - List explicit "always do" behaviors
  - List explicit "never do" constraints
  - Think about edge cases: what if verification fails? caller gets frustrated? agent doesn't know the answer?
  - Define escalation paths
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="4. End Conditions">
  *When should the call end?*
  
  **Tips:**
  - Issue resolved and confirmed
  - Customer says goodbye or thanks
  - Successful transfer to human
  - No response after multiple attempts
</Accordion>

## After You Click Create

AI generates your agent and opens the editor with everything already set up:

- **Prompt** — fully written based on your four inputs
- **Voice** — the one you selected
- **Model** — configured and ready
- **Knowledge Base** — attached if you chose one

From there, refine as needed and test.
