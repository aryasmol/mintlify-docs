The center of the Single Prompt editor is where you tell your agent who to be and how to behave. It's a **markdown editor**, so you can use headings, lists, bold text, and other formatting to organize your instructions clearly.

---

## Section Navigation

Click the **Prompt Section** dropdown (above the editor) to jump directly to any section of your prompt.

<Frame caption="The Prompt Editor with section dropdown">
  <img src="/platform/building-agents/images/prompt-editor.png" alt="Prompt editor" />
</Frame>

The dropdown reads your markdown headings and creates a navigation menu. This is especially useful for longer prompts — instead of scrolling, you can jump straight to:

- Role & Objective
- Personality & Tone
- Conversational Flow
- Common Questions
- End Conditions
- Or any custom sections you create

<Tip>
**Templates are structured this way.** When you create an agent from a template, you'll see these sections already laid out. Even starting from scratch, using clear markdown headings keeps your prompt organized and easy to navigate.

## Writing in Markdown

Use standard markdown formatting:

| Format | Syntax | Use For |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Headings** | `## Section Name` | Organize major sections (shows in dropdown) |
| **Bullet lists** | `- item` | Personality traits, guidelines, rules |
| **Numbered lists** | `1. step` | Conversational flows, procedures |
| **Bold** | `**text**` | Emphasis on key points |

### Example Structure

```markdown
## Role & Objective

You are Sarah, a claims support specialist for Acme Insurance.
Your goal is to help policyholders check claim status and understand next steps.

## Personality & Tone

- Warm and empathetic — claims are stressful
- Clear and jargon-free
- Patient and never rushed

## Conversational Flow

1. Greet and verify identity
2. Ask how you can help
3. Look up their claim
4. Provide status update
5. Answer follow-up questions
6. Confirm next steps and close

## End Conditions

End the call when:
- Caller confirms they have what they need
- They say goodbye
- No response after 3 attempts
```

## Using Variables

Make your prompts dynamic with variables:

```markdown
Hello {{customer_name}}! I see you're calling about order #{{order_id}}.
```

Variables get replaced at runtime with actual values from your data or API responses.
