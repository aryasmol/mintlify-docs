Locking freezes your agent's configuration — preventing accidental changes while it handles live calls. It's the safeguard between testing and production.

---

## What Locking Does

When you lock an agent:

- **Prompt cannot be edited** — Your carefully tested prompt stays exactly as is
- **Settings are frozen** — Voice, LLM, language settings stay fixed
- **Workflow is immutable** — For Convo Flow agents, nodes and branches can't change
- **API configurations are protected** — Integration settings remain stable

You can still:
- View the agent configuration
- View conversation logs
- Make test calls
- Create a new unlocked version

## When to Lock

### Before Going Live

Lock immediately before connecting your agent to a live phone number or widget. This ensures:

- The tested version is exactly what goes live
- No one accidentally changes something
- You have a known-good baseline to return to

### After Major Changes

After significant prompt or workflow updates that you've thoroughly tested:

1. Test the changes completely
2. Confirm everything works
3. Lock the agent
4. Then deploy to production

### For Compliance

Some industries require change management for production systems. Locking provides:

- A clear record of what configuration was live when
- Protection against unauthorized changes
- Audit trail of version history

## Signs You're Ready to Lock

Ask yourself these questions:

| Question | If "Yes" → Ready to Lock |
|----------|--------------------------|
| Have I tested all common scenarios? | ✓ |
| Have I tested edge cases? | ✓ |
| Have I had others test it? | ✓ |
| Am I confident in the current behavior? | ✓ |
| Are all integrations working correctly? | ✓ |
| Does the voice and tone match my brand? | ✓ |

If you answered "no" to any of these, keep testing before locking.

## When NOT to Lock

**During Active Development**
If you're still iterating frequently, locking just creates extra steps. Wait until you've reached a stable point.

**If You're Unsure**
Locking isn't urgent. If you're not confident the agent is ready, keep testing.

**For Quick Experiments**
Testing new prompt ideas? Don't lock between every experiment. Lock only when you've found what works.

## The Lock-Test-Deploy Workflow

A typical safe workflow:

```
1. Develop agent (unlocked)
2. Test thoroughly
3. Lock the agent ← You are confident
4. Deploy to live phone number
5. Monitor conversation logs
6. If changes needed:
   - Create new version (unlocked)
   - Make changes
   - Test again
   - Lock new version
   - Deploy new version
```

---

## Multiple Environments

For larger teams, consider:

**Development Agent (Unlocked)**
Where you make and test changes freely.

**Staging Agent (Locked)**
A locked version connected to a test phone number for final validation.

**Production Agent (Locked)**
The version actually handling customer calls, always locked.

Changes flow from Development → Staging → Production, with locking at each promotion.
