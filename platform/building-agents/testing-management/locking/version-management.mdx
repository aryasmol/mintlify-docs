Version management lets you maintain multiple configurations of your agent — enabling safe iteration without disrupting live traffic.

---

## Why Versioning Matters

Without versioning, every change to your agent affects live calls immediately. That's risky:

- A typo in your prompt could confuse callers
- A broken API configuration could crash conversations
- Testing in production means real customers experience bugs

Versioning gives you a safety net. Work on changes separately, test thoroughly, then promote when ready.

---

## How Versioning Works

Each agent can have multiple versions:

```
My Support Agent
├── v1 (locked, live on +1-555-0100)
├── v2 (locked, archived)
└── v3 (unlocked, in development)
```

Only one version handles live traffic at a time. Others exist for development, testing, or historical reference.

---

## Creating a New Version

To create a new version:

1. Go to your agent's settings or version panel
2. Click **Create New Version**
3. Choose to copy from:
   - Current version (start with existing config)
   - Blank slate (start fresh)
4. The new version is created **unlocked** for editing

The new version gets a version number automatically (v2, v3, etc.).

---

## Version Lifecycle

A typical version goes through these stages:

```
Created (unlocked)
    ↓ editing and testing
Locked
    ↓ final testing
Deployed
    ↓ live traffic
Superseded
    ↓ replaced by newer version
Archived
```

### Stage Details

| Stage | What's Happening |
|-------|------------------|
| **Created** | New version, actively being edited |
| **Locked** | Configuration frozen, ready for deployment |
| **Deployed** | Handling live traffic |
| **Superseded** | Was live, now replaced by newer version |
| **Archived** | Kept for reference but no longer active |

---

## Switching Live Versions

To switch which version handles live calls:

1. Ensure the new version is locked
2. Go to the phone number configuration
3. Change the assigned agent version
4. Confirm the switch

<Info>
The switch is nearly instant. In-progress calls continue on the old version; new calls go to the new version.
</Info>

---

## Comparing Versions

When deciding whether to deploy a new version, compare it to the current live version:

**Configuration Diff**
See exactly what changed between versions — prompt text, settings, workflow structure.

**Test Results**
Compare test call outcomes. Does the new version handle the same scenarios correctly?

**Metrics Preview**
If possible, A/B test the new version with a portion of traffic before full deployment.

---

## Rolling Back

If a new version has problems, roll back quickly:

1. Go to phone number configuration
2. Switch back to the previous version
3. The old version resumes handling calls

Because locked versions are frozen, the old version is exactly as you left it.

<Tip>
Don't delete old versions immediately. Keep at least one previous version available for quick rollback.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Always develop on unlocked versions">
    Never unlock a live version to make changes. Create a new version instead. This protects live traffic from in-progress changes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Lock before deploying">
    Only deploy locked versions. This ensures the configuration is frozen and stable.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test the actual version you'll deploy">
    Don't test on v3 then deploy v4 because "they're basically the same." Test the exact version going live.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use descriptive version notes">
    When creating a new version, add notes about what changes it contains. Future you will thank present you.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Clean up old versions">
    Archive versions you no longer need. Keep the current live version and one previous version for rollback.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Version Strategy for Teams

For teams with multiple people working on agents:

**Development Branch**
Unlocked versions where individual contributors make changes. Each person might have their own development version.

**Staging Version**
A locked version deployed to a test phone number. Team reviews changes here before production.

**Production Version**
The locked version handling real customer calls. Changes only come through the staging process.

```
Development → Staging → Production
  (unlocked)   (locked)   (locked)
```

---

## Version Limits

Each agent can have a limited number of versions (check your plan). To free up version slots:

- Archive versions you no longer need
- Delete versions that were never deployed
- Consolidate abandoned development versions
