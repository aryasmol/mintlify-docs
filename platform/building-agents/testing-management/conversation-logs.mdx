Conversation Logs record every interaction your agent has — test calls, live calls, all of them. They're your window into what's actually happening in conversations, essential for debugging, optimization, and quality assurance.

---

## Accessing Conversation Logs

Find Conversation Logs in the top bar of your agent editor, or through the main dashboard.

Each entry shows a complete conversation with all the details you need to understand what happened.

## What's in a Log

Each conversation log contains:

### Call Metadata

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Call ID** | Unique identifier for this conversation |
| **Timestamp** | When the call happened |
| **Duration** | How long it lasted |
| **Direction** | Inbound or outbound |
| **Phone Number** | Caller's number (if available) |
| **Disposition** | How the call ended (successful, unsuccessful, transferred, etc.) |

### Transcript

A full text record of everything said — both by the caller and your agent. Each turn is timestamped.

```
[00:02] Agent: Hi, this is Jordan from TechStore. How can I help you today?
[00:05] Caller: Yeah, I need to return something I bought last week.
[00:08] Agent: I'd be happy to help with that. Could you tell me what item you'd like to return?
[00:12] Caller: The wireless headphones, they don't fit right.
...
```

### Audio Recording

The actual audio of the call (if recording is enabled). Listen to hear tone, pacing, and things the transcript might miss.

### Variables

All variables used in the conversation — what values they had and when they changed.

### API Activity

For Convo Flow agents: which API calls were made, what data was sent/received, and whether they succeeded.

### Branch Decisions

For Convo Flow agents: which branches were taken and why. Understand the path the conversation followed.

## Using Logs for Debugging

When something goes wrong, logs tell you exactly what happened:

### Common Issues to Look For

**Speech Recognition Errors**
The transcript shows what the system *thought* it heard. If it's wrong, that explains downstream problems.

```
Caller actually said: "I want to cancel my order"
System heard: "I want to cancel my daughter"
```

**Intent Misunderstanding**
The caller's words were transcribed correctly, but the agent misinterpreted the intent.

**Wrong Branch Taken**
In Convo Flow, check which branches fired. The AI's interpretation might differ from your expectation.

**API Failures**
Check the API activity section. Failed calls explain why data wasn't available or actions weren't taken.

## Filtering and Searching

With many calls, you need to find specific conversations:

### Filter Options

| Filter | What It Finds |
|--------|---------------|
| **Date Range** | Calls within a specific period |
| **Disposition** | Only successful, unsuccessful, or transferred calls |
| **Duration** | Calls shorter or longer than a threshold |
| **Phone Number** | Calls from/to a specific number |
| **Contains Text** | Calls where specific words appear in transcript |

### Useful Searches

- **Short calls** — Often indicate quick hang-ups or problems
- **Long calls** — May reveal conversations that got stuck
- **Unsuccessful dispositions** — Learn why calls fail
- **Calls with transfers** — Understand what AI couldn't handle

---

## Analyzing Patterns

Look beyond individual calls to spot trends:

**Frequent Fallbacks**
If many calls trigger fallback branches, your prompts may need more specific handling.

**Common Questions**
What do callers ask most? Make sure these are handled excellently.

**Transfer Reasons**
Why are calls being transferred? Can AI handle more of these?

**Drop-off Points**
Where do unsuccessful calls fail? Early hang-ups vs. mid-conversation issues tell different stories.

---

## Using Logs for Improvement

Turn log insights into agent improvements:

1. **Review regularly** — Set aside time weekly to review a sample of calls
2. **Categorize issues** — Group problems by type (prompt, understanding, integration)
3. **Prioritize by impact** — Fix issues that affect the most callers first
4. **Make targeted changes** — Adjust prompts, add branches, fix integrations
5. **Track results** — See if the same issues recur after your changes

## Privacy and Compliance

<Info>
Conversation logs may contain personally identifiable information (PII). Ensure your logging practices comply with relevant regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) and your company's data policies.
</Info>

### Data Retention

Configure how long logs are kept. Shorter retention reduces storage and compliance risk. Longer retention enables more analysis.

### Recording Consent

For calls with audio recording, ensure appropriate consent disclosures are made at the start of calls, as required by law.

### Access Control

Limit who can view conversation logs. Not everyone needs access to customer call recordings.
