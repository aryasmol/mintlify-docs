The workflow builder is your visual studio for creating conversation flows. Drag, drop, connect, and design exactly how your agent should guide callers.

    - **Drag** to pan around the canvas
    - **Scroll** to zoom in/out
    
    <Accordion title="Canvas Navigation">
      | Action | How |
      |--------|-----|
      | Pan | Click and drag on empty space |
      | Zoom | Scroll wheel or +/- buttons |
      | Select node | Click on it |
      | Multi-select | Shift + click |
      | Delete | Select + Delete/Backspace |
    </Accordion>

    The bottom bar provides quick actions:
    
    | Button | Icon | Function |
    |--------|------|----------|
    | Feedback | 👍 | Send feedback to Atoms |
    | Auto-layout | ↕️ | Automatically organize nodes |
    | Zoom in | + | Closer view |
    | Zoom out | − | Wider view |
    
    <Tip>
    **Use Auto-layout often.** It keeps your flow readable as it grows.

## Working with Nodes

### Adding Nodes

<Frame caption="Dragging a node to canvas">
  [IMAGE: Animation-style showing node being dragged from palette]
</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the Node">
    Locate the node type in the left palette.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Drag to Canvas">
    Click, hold, and drag onto the canvas.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Release to Place">
    Let go where you want the node.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Connecting Nodes

<Frame caption="Connection being drawn between nodes">
  [IMAGE: Line being drawn from one node to another]
</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the Handle">
    Each node has connection handles (small circles on edges).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Drag the Connection">
    Click and drag from an output handle.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Drop on Target">
    Release on another node's input handle.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Connections flow **top to bottom** and **left to right** by convention. Auto-layout helps maintain this.
</Note>

### Configuring Nodes

<Frame caption="Node configuration panel open">
  [IMAGE: Selected node with configuration panel visible]
</Frame>

Click any node to open its settings. Each type has different options:

| Node Type | Configuration Options |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Default** | Prompt text, output branches, conditions |
| **Transfer** | Phone number, transfer type, messages |
| **API Call** | Endpoint, headers, body, response mapping |
| **End Call** | Closing message |

### Deleting Nodes

<Frame caption="Node being deleted">
  [IMAGE: Node selected with delete indication]
</Frame>

1. **Select** the node (click on it)
2. Press **Delete** or **Backspace**
3. Confirm if prompted

<Warning>
Deleting a node also removes all its connections. Make sure to reconnect orphaned nodes.
</Warning>

### Moving Nodes

Simply drag any node to reposition it on the canvas.

<Frame caption="Node being repositioned">
  [IMAGE: Node being dragged to new position]
</Frame>

<Tip>
After moving nodes manually, click **Auto-layout** to clean up the arrangement.
</Tip>

## Working with Connections

### Understanding Connections

<Frame caption="Connection anatomy">
  [IMAGE: Close-up of a connection line with labels]
</Frame>

Connections define the conversation path:
- **Lines** show flow direction
- **Arrows** indicate where the conversation goes next
- **Labels** can show condition names

### Editing Connections

<Frame caption="Connection being modified">
  [IMAGE: Connection line being redirected]
</Frame>

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| Remove | Click connection → Delete |
| Redirect | Delete and create new |
| Add label | Configure in source node's branch settings |

### Branch Connections

A single node can have multiple output connections for branching:

## Best Practices

<Accordion title="Keep flows readable">
  <Frame caption="Clean vs messy flow comparison">
    [IMAGE: Side-by-side of organized flow vs tangled flow]
  </Frame>
  
  - Use **Auto-layout** regularly
  - Flow top-to-bottom, left-to-right
  - Group related nodes visually
  - Don't cross lines if avoidable
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Name nodes descriptively">
  <Frame caption="Well-named nodes">
    [IMAGE: Nodes with clear names like "Ask Budget" vs generic "Step 3"]
  </Frame>
  
  | Good Names | Bad Names |
  |------------|-----------|
  | "Verify Identity" | "Step 1" |
  | "Budget Question" | "Node 5" |
  | "Transfer to Sales" | "Transfer" |
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Test as you build">
  Don't wait until the flow is complete to test. Validate each section:
  
  1. Build a few nodes
  2. Test that section
  3. Continue building
  4. Test the new section
  5. Repeat
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Plan your branches">
  Before building, sketch out:
  - What questions lead to branches?
  - What are all possible answers?
  - Where does each path end?
</Accordion>

## Keyboard Shortcuts

<Frame caption="Keyboard shortcuts panel">
  [IMAGE: Shortcuts help panel expanded]
</Frame>

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Delete` / `Backspace` | Delete selected |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + Z` | Undo |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Z` | Redo |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + A` | Select all |
| `Escape` | Deselect |
