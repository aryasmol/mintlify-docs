Describing your ideal conversation is easier than building it node by node. Let AI generate the flow, then refine it to perfection.

## Conversational Flow AI Tips

When using Create with AI for Conversational Flow agents:

<Accordion title="Describe the step-by-step process">
  The clearer your steps, the better the generated flow.
  
  **Example:** "First verify the caller's identity with their phone number. Then ask why they're calling. If it's a billing issue, collect the invoice number. If it's technical support, ask what product they're using."
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Specify branch conditions">
  Tell the AI when conversations should split into different paths.
  
  **Example:** "If the budget is over $10,000, transfer to a senior sales rep. If under $10,000, send them to self-serve resources."
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Define all endings">
  Describe how each path should conclude.
  
  **Example:** "Qualified leads should be transferred to sales. Unqualified leads should receive a follow-up email. Support issues should end with a ticket confirmation."
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Mention required data collection">
  List what information must be gathered.
  
  **Example:** "Must collect: name, company, budget range, timeline, and current solution before qualifying."
</Accordion>
