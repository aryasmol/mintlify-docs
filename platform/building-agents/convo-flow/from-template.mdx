## Tips for Template Success

<Accordion title="Walk through the flow first">
  Before customizing, trace every path. Understand why each node and branch exists.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Keep the structure, change the content">
  The template structure is battle-tested. Keep the logic, just update the specifics.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Test before AND after changes">
  Run through the template as-is first. Then test again after every significant change.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Check all branches">
  It's easy to customize the main path and forget alternate branches. Test every route.
</Accordion>
