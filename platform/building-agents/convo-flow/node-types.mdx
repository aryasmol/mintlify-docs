Nodes are the building blocks of your conversation flow. Each type serves a specific purpose in guiding the conversation.

## Node Types at a Glance

| Node | Icon | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| [Default](#default-node) | 🔷 | Conversation step | Each conversation point |
| [Transfer Call](#transfer-call-node) | 📞 | Handoff to human | Connect to live agent |

## Default Node

The workhorse of your flow. Each Default node represents one step in the conversation.

<Frame caption="Default node on canvas">
  [IMAGE: Default node card showing title and connection points]
</Frame>

### Configuration

<Frame caption="Default node configuration panel">
  [IMAGE: Panel showing all Default node settings]
</Frame>

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Name** | Identifier shown on canvas |
| **Prompt** | What the agent says at this step |
| **Branches** | Output paths based on caller response |

### Example Prompts

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Greeting">
    ```
    Hi! Thanks for calling Acme Support. My name is Alex. 
    How can I help you today?
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Question">
    ```
    I'd be happy to help with that. First, could you tell 
    me your account number or the email on file?
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Confirmation">
    ```
    Just to confirm — you'd like to schedule a demo for 
    next Tuesday at 2pm. Is that correct?
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Branching

Default nodes can have multiple output branches:

## Transfer Call Node

Hands the conversation to a human agent via phone transfer.

<Frame caption="Transfer Call node on canvas">
  [IMAGE: Transfer Call node card with phone icon]
</Frame>

### Configuration

<Frame caption="Transfer Call configuration">
  [IMAGE: Transfer settings panel showing all options]
</Frame>

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Name** | Identifier |
| **Description** | When this transfer should trigger |
| **Phone Number** | Transfer destination (with country code) |
| **Transfer Type** | Cold or Warm |

### Transfer Types

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Cold Transfer">
    <Frame caption="Cold transfer visualization">
      [IMAGE: Diagram showing immediate handoff]
    </Frame>
    
    **Immediate handoff.** The caller is connected directly without any briefing to the receiving agent.
    
    **Best for:**
    - Simple escalations
    - When context isn't needed
    - Time-sensitive transfers
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Warm Transfer">
    <Frame caption="Warm transfer visualization">
      [IMAGE: Diagram showing AI briefing the human, then connecting caller]
    </Frame>
    
    **AI briefs the agent first.** The receiving agent gets context before the caller joins.
    
    **Additional Options:**
    
    | Option | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | On-hold Music | What caller hears while waiting |
    | Transfer if Human | Skip if voicemail (coming soon) |
    | Whisper Message | Private message to agent only |
    | Handoff Message | What the agent hears |
    | Three-way Message | What both parties hear |
    
    **Best for:**
    - Complex issues needing context
    - VIP callers
    - When continuity matters
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## API Call Node

Makes external API requests during the conversation.

<Frame caption="API Call node on canvas">
  [IMAGE: API Call node card with arrow icon]
</Frame>

### Configuration

<Frame caption="API Call configuration">
  [IMAGE: API settings panel with all fields]
</Frame>

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Name** | Identifier |
| **URL** | Endpoint to call |
| **Method** | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE |
| **Headers** | Request headers |
| **Body** | Request payload |
| **Response Mapping** | Map response to variables |

### Example: Customer Lookup

<Frame caption="Customer lookup API configuration">
  [IMAGE: API node configured for customer lookup]
</Frame>

```
URL: https://api.example.com/customers
Method: GET
Query: ?phone={{caller_phone}}

Response Mapping:
  data.name → {{api.customer_name}}
  data.tier → {{api.account_tier}}
```

Then use in a later node:

```
"Hello {{api.customer_name}}! I see you're a {{api.account_tier}} 
member. How can I help you today?"
```

→ Learn more: [API Calls](/platform/building-agents/configuring/api-calls)

## End Call Node

Terminates the conversation.

<Frame caption="End Call node on canvas">

</Frame>

### Configuration

<Frame caption="End Call configuration">
  [IMAGE: End Call settings panel]
</Frame>

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Name** | Identifier |
| **Closing Message** | Final words before hanging up |

### Example Closings

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Successful">
    ```
    Great! You're all set. Is there anything else I can 
    help you with today? ... Perfect, thank you for calling 
    Acme. Have a wonderful day!
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Transferred">
    ```
    I'm connecting you now. Thanks for calling Acme, and 
    have a great day!
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Not Qualified">
    ```
    Thanks so much for your interest. I'll have someone 
    send over some resources that might be helpful. Take care!
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
**Every path must end.** Make sure all branches eventually reach an End Call or Transfer node.
</Warning>

## Pre-Call API Node

Fetches data before the conversation begins.

  [IMAGE: Pre-Call API node with distinctive coloring]
</Frame>

### When It Runs

<Frame caption="Pre-Call API timing diagram">
  [IMAGE: Timeline showing API call happening before Start node]
</Frame>

The Pre-Call API runs:
1. Phone rings
2. **Pre-Call API executes** ← Here
3. Data available
4. Conversation starts

### Use Cases

| Scenario | API Call |
|----------|----------|
| **CRM Lookup** | Get caller history before greeting |
| **Account Status** | Check if caller has issues |
| **Personalization** | Load name, preferences |
| **Routing** | Determine which flow to use |

### Example

<Frame caption="Pre-Call API for CRM lookup">
  [IMAGE: Pre-Call API configured for customer lookup]
</Frame>

```
URL: https://crm.example.com/lookup?phone={{caller_phone}}

Response:
  customer_name → {{api.name}}
  last_issue → {{api.last_ticket}}
  tier → {{api.tier}}
```

First node can now say:

```
"Hi {{api.name}}! Thanks for calling back. Are you still 
having trouble with {{api.last_ticket}}?"
```

---

## Post-Call API Node

Sends data after the conversation ends.

<Frame caption="Post-Call API node on canvas">
  [IMAGE: Post-Call API node with distinctive coloring]
</Frame>

### When It Runs

<Frame caption="Post-Call API timing diagram">
  [IMAGE: Timeline showing API call happening after End Call]
</Frame>

The Post-Call API runs:
1. Conversation ends
2. Call terminates
3. **Post-Call API executes** ← Here
4. Data saved externally

### Use Cases

| Scenario | What to Send |
|----------|--------------|
| **CRM Update** | Call summary, outcome |
| **Ticket Creation** | Issue details, priority |
| **Lead Capture** | Collected qualification data |
| **Analytics** | Custom metrics, disposition |

### Example

<Frame caption="Post-Call API for CRM update">
  [IMAGE: Post-Call API configured to update CRM]
</Frame>

```
URL: https://crm.example.com/calls
Method: POST
Body:
{
  "phone": "{{caller_phone}}",
  "duration": "{{call_duration}}",
  "outcome": "{{disposition}}",
  "notes": "{{call_summary}}",
  "collected": {
    "name": "{{collected.name}}",
    "budget": "{{collected.budget}}",
    "timeline": "{{collected.timeline}}"
  }
}
```
