Conversational Flow agents give you complete control over conversation paths. Design visual workflows with nodes and branches, ensuring callers get exactly the experience you intend.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Design Your Flow">
    Create nodes for each conversation step. Connect them to define paths.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Branches">
    Define conditions that route callers down different paths based on their responses.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Caller Navigates">
    As callers speak, the AI guides them through your designed flow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Goal Achieved">
    Each path leads to a defined outcome — transfer, booking, qualification, etc.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## When to Use Conversational Flow

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Perfect For" icon="check">
    - Lead qualification
    - Appointment scheduling
    - Multi-step intake forms
    - Compliance-required conversations
    - Processes with clear stages
    - When you need specific data collected
  </Card>
  <Card title="Consider Alternatives" icon="xmark">
    - Completely open-ended conversations
    - Simple FAQ (overkill)
    - When flexibility matters more than structure
    - Very short interactions

## Real-World Examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Lead Qualification">
    <Frame caption="Lead qualification workflow">
      [IMAGE: Flow diagram: Greeting → Company Info → Budget → Timeline → Qualify/Disqualify → Transfer]
    </Frame>
    
    **The flow:**
    ```
    [Greeting] → [Company Size?] → [Current Solution?] 
        → [Budget Range?] → [Timeline?] 
            → Qualified? → [Transfer to Sales]
            → Not Qualified? → [Send Resources]
    ```
    
    **Why Conversational Flow works:** You need specific information in a specific order. Every lead gets the same thorough qualification.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Appointment Booking">
    <Frame caption="Appointment booking workflow">
      [IMAGE: Flow diagram: Verify → Service Type → Date/Time → Confirm → End]
    </Frame>
    
    **The flow:**
    ```
    [Verify Caller] → [What Service?] → [Preferred Date?] 
        → Check Availability
            → Available? → [Confirm Booking]
            → Not Available? → [Offer Alternatives]
    ```
    
    **Why Conversational Flow works:** Booking requires checking availability and confirming multiple details. Branches handle the "what if not available" scenario gracefully.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Insurance Intake">
    <Frame caption="Insurance intake workflow">
      [IMAGE: Flow diagram with multiple branches for different coverage types]
    </Frame>
    
    **The flow:**
    ```
    [Verify Identity] → [Reason for Call?]
        → New Policy? → [Coverage Type] → [Quote Details]
        → Existing Policy? → [Policy Lookup] → [Handle Request]
        → File Claim? → [Claim Intake]
    ```
    
    **Why Conversational Flow works:** Different intents require completely different paths. The visual workflow makes this complexity manageable.

## Key Concepts

<Frame caption="Workflow concepts diagram">
  [IMAGE: Visual showing nodes, branches, and paths annotated]
</Frame>

| Concept | What It Is | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Node** | A step in the conversation | "Ask about budget" |
| **Branch** | A conditional path | "If budget > $10k, go to Premium Path" |
| **Path** | A route through nodes | Start → Qualify → Transfer |
| **Prompt** | Text in each node | "What's your approximate budget?" |

## Pros & Cons

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Complete control over conversation | More setup time |
| Predictable, consistent outcomes | Can feel scripted if not done well |
| Easy to ensure data collection | Harder to handle unexpected topics |
| Visual — easy to understand | Requires more maintenance |
| Great for compliance | Branches can get complex |
