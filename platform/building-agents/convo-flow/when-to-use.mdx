Conversational Flow agents give you precise control over every step of a conversation through a visual workflow builder. They're powerful but require more setup than Single Prompt agents.

---

## Ideal Use Cases

Conversational Flow agents excel when you need **structure and control**:

### Lead Qualification Workflows

When you need to ask specific qualifying questions, score responses, and route leads based on criteria, Conversational Flow makes this logic visual and clear.

### Appointment Booking

Scheduling with multiple conditions — available times, service types, locations, staff preferences — benefits from defined decision paths.

### Multi-Step Data Collection

Insurance intake, loan applications, or any process collecting specific information in a specific order works well with structured flows.

### Compliance-Required Conversations

When regulations require specific disclosures, verifications, or sequences, Conversational Flow ensures nothing is skipped.

### Support Ticket Routing

Triage calls into specific categories and route to the right team based on a defined decision tree.

### Surveys and Feedback Collection

Structured questionnaires with branching logic based on responses.

---

## Not Ideal For

Conversational Flow is overkill when you need **flexibility over structure**:

### Completely Open-Ended Conversations

If callers might discuss anything and you want natural flow, Single Prompt is simpler.

### Simple FAQ Bots

For basic Q&A without specific paths, Single Prompt handles variety better.

### When Flexibility Matters More

If conversations should feel natural rather than guided, Single Prompt is more appropriate.

### Quick Prototypes

Single Prompt is faster to set up when testing ideas.

## What You'll Build

With Conversational Flow, you create a visual workflow:

```
[Start] → [Greeting] → [Ask Question 1]
                              ↓
              ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
              ↓               ↓               ↓
         [Option A]      [Option B]      [Other]
              ↓               ↓               ↓
         [Next Step]    [Different Path] [Clarify]
              ↓               ↓               ↓
            ...             ...             ...
              └───────────────┼───────────────┘
                              ↓
                          [End Call]
```

Each box is a **node**. Lines between them are **branches** with conditions.

## Example Scenarios

**Good for Conversational Flow:**
- "Let me qualify you for our service"
- "I need to verify your identity"
- "Let's schedule your appointment"
- "I have a few questions for our survey"

**Better for Single Prompt:**
- "I have a random question"
- "Tell me about your company"
- "I'm not sure what I need"
