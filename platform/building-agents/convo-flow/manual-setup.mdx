## Step 3: Build Your First Flow

Let's create a simple lead qualification flow.

### Add the Start Node

Every flow begins with a **Start Node** — it's added automatically.

<Frame caption="Canvas with Start node">
  [IMAGE: Canvas showing green Start node pill]
</Frame>

### Add Your First Conversation Node

<Steps>
  <Step title="Drag a Default Node">
    From the Node Palette, drag a **Default Node** onto the canvas.
    
    <Frame caption="Dragging a Default node">
      [IMAGE: Hand cursor dragging node from palette to canvas]
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Connect from Start">
    Drag from the Start node's handle to your new node.
    
    <Frame caption="Connecting nodes">
      [IMAGE: Connection line being drawn between nodes]
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure the Node">
    Click the node to open its settings. Add your prompt:
    
    ```
    Hi! Thanks for calling [Company]. I'm here to help 
    you find the right solution. To get started, could 
    you tell me your name?
    ```
    
    <Frame caption="Node configuration panel">
      [IMAGE: Node settings panel with prompt field]
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Continue the Flow

Add more nodes for each step in your conversation:

<Frame caption="Growing workflow with multiple nodes">
  [IMAGE: Canvas showing Start → Greeting → Ask Budget → Ask Timeline]
</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add 'Ask Budget' Node">
    ```
    Great, {{name}}! What's your approximate budget 
    for this project?
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add 'Ask Timeline' Node">
    ```
    And when are you looking to get started?
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add 'Qualify' Node">
    Based on responses, determine if lead is qualified.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Add an End Node

Every path needs an ending.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Drag an End Call Node">
    From the palette, add an **End Call** node.
    
    <Frame caption="End Call node on canvas">
      [IMAGE: Red End Call node at end of flow]
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure the Ending">
    Set the goodbye message:
    
    ```
    Thanks so much for your time! We'll be in touch 
    within 24 hours. Have a great day!
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 4: Add Branches

Branches let you route conversations based on caller responses.

<Frame caption="Flow with branches splitting into two paths">
  [IMAGE: Node with two output branches going to different paths]
</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click a Node">
    Open the node you want to branch from.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Conditions">
    Define what triggers each branch.
    
    <Frame caption="Branch condition configuration">
      [IMAGE: Node settings showing condition inputs]
    </Frame>
    
    | Condition Type | Example |
    |----------------|---------|
    | **Text Match** | User says "not interested" |
    | **Intent** | User expresses budget concern |
    | **Variable** | `{{budget}}` > 10000 |
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Connect Each Branch">
    Draw connections from each condition to its destination node.
    
    <Frame caption="Multiple branches connected">
      [IMAGE: One node with three output branches to different paths]
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Always add a default/fallback branch.** Handle unexpected responses gracefully.
</Tip>

## Step 5: Configure Settings

Click the **Settings** tab to access agent configuration.

<Frame caption="Settings tab selected">
  [IMAGE: Top toggle showing Settings tab active]
</Frame>

The Settings tab contains the same options as Single Prompt agents:

| Setting Area | What to Configure |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Voice** | Speech settings, pronunciation, detection |
| **Model** | LLM selection, language switching |
| **Phone Number** | Assign a number |
| **Webhook** | Event notifications |
| **General** | Timeouts |

## Step 6: Test Your Flow

<Frame caption="Test Agent modal">
  [IMAGE: Modal showing Telephony, Web Call, and Chat options]
</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click 'Test Agent'">
    Top right corner of the builder.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose Test Mode">
    - **Web Call** — Quick browser test
    - **Telephony** — Real phone experience
    - **Chat** — Text-only for logic testing
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Walk Through Your Flow">
    Test every branch. Try edge cases.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review in Logs">
    Check Convo Logs to see exactly which nodes were hit.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Test every branch.** It's easy to miss an edge case that breaks the flow.
</Warning>
