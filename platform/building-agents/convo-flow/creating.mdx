This guide walks you through creating a Conversational Flow agent from scratch. By the end, you'll have a working workflow ready for testing.

## Steps to Create

### Step 1: Start Creation

1. Click the green **"Create Agent"** button (top right of dashboard)
2. Select **"Start from scratch"**
3. Choose **"Conversational Flow"**

The workflow builder opens.

---

### Step 2: Understand the Layout

| Area | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Toggle Tabs** | Top center | Switch between "Workflow" and "Settings" |
| **Node Palette** | Left panel | Drag-and-drop node types |
| **Canvas** | Center | Visual flow editor |
| **Variables** | Right panel | `{ }` Variables button |

**Top Right Actions** (same as Single Prompt):
- Convo Logs
- Lock Agent
- Test Agent

**Header:**
- Back arrow (←) — return to agents list
- Agent name — click to rename
- Agent ID — click to copy

---

### Step 3: Start with the Canvas

The canvas shows a **Start Node** (green pill) at the top. This is where every conversation begins.

Your workflow will flow down from this starting point.

---

### Step 4: Add Your First Node

1. In the Node Palette (left), find **Default Node**
2. Drag it onto the canvas below the Start Node
3. A connection line appears — drop the node to connect it

---

### Step 5: Configure the Node

1. Click the node to select it
2. A configuration panel opens
3. Write the node's prompt — what should the agent say here?

**Example for a greeting node:**
```
Hi! Thanks for calling TechStore. I'm here to help you today. 
Are you calling about an existing order, or do you have a product question?
```

---

### Step 6: Add Conditions and Branches

From your first node, add branches for different user responses:

1. In the node config, find the conditions/branches section
2. Add conditions like:
   - "User mentions order" → connects to Order Help node
   - "User asks product question" → connects to Product Info node
   - "Other" → connects to Clarification node

---

### Step 7: Build Out the Flow

Continue adding nodes for each conversation path:

1. Drag more nodes from the palette
2. Connect branches to appropriate next nodes
3. Configure each node's prompt
4. Ensure all paths eventually reach an **End Call** node

---

### Step 8: Configure Settings

Click the **"Settings"** toggle tab to access:

- Voice settings (same as Single Prompt)
- Model configuration
- Phone number assignment
- Webhooks
- General settings

These work identically to Single Prompt configuration.

---

### Step 9: Test Your Flow

1. Click **"Test Agent"** (top right)
2. Choose test mode
3. Walk through your conversation paths
4. Check that each branch works correctly

**Important:** Test EVERY path in your flow. Untested branches may have issues.

## Canvas Controls

At the bottom of the canvas:

| Button | Function |
|--------|----------|
| 👍 | Submit feedback |
| ↕️ | Auto-layout (organize nodes neatly) |
| + | Zoom in |
| - | Zoom out |

**Tip:** Use auto-layout frequently to keep your flow readable.

---

## Your Agent is Ready

You now have a working Conversational Flow agent. From here, you can:

- Add more nodes and branches
- Configure API calls for data lookup
- Set up transfer nodes for human handoff
- Test thoroughly before deploying
