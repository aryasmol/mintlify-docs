This guide walks you through creating a working Convo Flow agent. By the end, you'll have a multi-step conversation flow you can actually call and test.

---

## Step 1: Create Your Agent

From your dashboard, click **Create Agent** in the top-right corner.

</Frame>

---

## Step 2: Fill In Basic Details

A modal appears asking for basic information:

<Frame caption="Create Agent modal">
  <img src="/images/agent-modal.png" alt="Create Agent modal" />
</Frame>

| Field | What to Enter |
|-------|---------------|
| **Agent Name** | Something descriptive — "Appointment Reminder", "Lead Qualifier", etc. |
| **Call Type** | **Outbound** (agent makes calls) or **Inbound** (customers call in) |
| **Voice** | Click to preview voices, pick one that matches your brand |
| **Language** | Primary language for the conversation |

---

## Step 3: Select Conversational Flow

Choose **Conversational flow agent** — it's labeled "For stronger guardrails".

</Frame>

This gives you access to the visual workflow builder.

---

## Step 4: Choose a Starting Point

**Start from Scratch**
Opens a blank canvas with just a Start node. Best when you have a specific flow in mind.

**Use a Template**
Pick a pre-built flow for your industry — Healthcare, E-commerce, Real Estate, Banking, Sales. Templates come with nodes and branches already configured that you can customize.

<Tip>
Even if your use case is unique, starting from a template is often faster. Delete what you don't need, keep what works.
</Tip>

---

## Step 5: Create the Agent

Click **Create agent**. 

Atoms processes your configuration (about 30 seconds), then drops you into the **Workflow Canvas**.

---

## Step 6: Explore the Canvas

<Frame caption="The workflow canvas">
  <img src="/images/workflow.png" alt="Workflow canvas interface" />
</Frame>

Take a moment to orient yourself:

**Left Panel** — Node palette. This is where you drag nodes from.

**Center** — Your workflow canvas. You'll see a Start node (or a template flow if you picked one).

**Right Panel** — Node configuration. Click any node to see its settings here.

**Top Bar** — Test Agent button, Conversation Logs, Lock Agent toggle.

---

## Step 7: Add Your First Node

Let's build a simple greeting:

1. From the left panel, drag a **Default Node** onto the canvas
2. Click the node to select it
3. In the right panel, find the **Prompt** field
4. Write your greeting:

```
Hi, this is an automated call from Dr. Smith's office. 
Am I speaking with {{customer_name}}?
```

The `{{customer_name}}` is a variable that gets replaced with actual data during the call.

---

## Step 8: Connect the Nodes

Draw a line from your Start node to your greeting node:

1. Hover over the Start node's output handle (small circle on the right)
2. Click and drag to your greeting node's input handle (circle on the left)
3. Release to create the connection

Your flow now has a path: Start → Greeting.

---

## Step 9: Add Branches

The caller will respond to your greeting. You need to handle different responses:

1. With your greeting node selected, find **Branches** in the right panel
2. Click **+ Add Branch**
3. Configure the first branch:
   - **Name:** "Confirmed"
   - **Condition:** "User confirms their identity"
   - **Next Node:** (we'll create this next)

4. Add another branch:
   - **Name:** "Wrong Person"
   - **Condition:** "User says it's the wrong number"

5. Add a fallback:
   - **Name:** "Unclear"
   - **Condition:** "Anything else"

---

## Step 10: Build Out the Flow

Now add nodes for each branch:

**For "Confirmed"** — Add a Default Node with the appointment details:
```
Great! I'm calling to remind you about your appointment on 
{{appointment_date}} at {{appointment_time}}. 
Would you like to confirm or reschedule?
```

**For "Wrong Person"** — Add an End Call Node with an apology:
```
I apologize for the confusion. I must have the wrong number. 
Have a great day!
```

**For "Unclear"** — Loop back to the greeting with a clarification:
```
I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. 
Am I speaking with {{customer_name}}?
```

Connect each branch to its corresponding node.

---

## Step 11: Add an End Point

Every path needs to end somewhere. Drag an **End Call** node and connect it to successful conversation completions:

```
Perfect! Your appointment is confirmed for {{appointment_date}} 
at {{appointment_time}}. We'll see you then. Have a wonderful day!
```

Set the **Disposition** to "Successful" so you can track outcomes.

---

## Step 12: Test Your Flow

Click **Test Agent** in the top bar.

1. Choose your testing method (web call or phone)
2. Walk through the conversation as a customer would
3. Try different paths — confirm identity, say wrong number, give unclear responses

After testing, check **Conversation Logs** to see exactly how the AI interpreted responses and which paths it took.
