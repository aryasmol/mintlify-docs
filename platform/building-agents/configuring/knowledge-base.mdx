A Knowledge Base is a repository of information your agent can search during conversations. Instead of cramming everything into the prompt, upload documents — product specs, policies, FAQs — and let the agent retrieve what it needs.

**Location:** Config Panel (right sidebar) → Knowledge Base toggle

---

## Setup

1. Toggle **Knowledge Base** ON
2. Select a KB from the dropdown

<Note>
You need to create a Knowledge Base first before you can attach it here. See [Creating Knowledge Bases](/platform/features/knowledge-base/creating).

## Local vs Global

| Type | Scope | Best For |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Local** | This agent only | Agent-specific information |
| **Global** | Shared across agents | Company-wide policies, general FAQs |

---

## How It Works

1. **Caller asks a question** → "What's your return policy?"
2. **Agent searches KB** → Finds relevant documents automatically
3. **Agent responds** → Uses retrieved information in the answer

The agent decides when to search based on the question. You don't need to configure triggers.

## Best Practices

<Accordion title="Use KB for reference, prompt for behavior">
  | Put in KB | Put in Prompt |
  |-----------|---------------|
  | Product details | Personality and tone |
  | Policies | Conversation patterns |
  | FAQ answers | End conditions |
  | Pricing info | Behavioral guidelines |
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Keep documents focused">
  Smaller, topic-specific documents retrieve better than massive catch-all files.
  
  | Better | Worse |
  |--------|-------|
  | `returns-policy.pdf` | `everything.pdf` |
  | `pricing-2024.txt` | `company-info.docx` (500 pages) |
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Test retrieval">
  Ask your agent questions that should hit the KB. Verify it finds the right information.
