Webhooks push data to your systems when events happen — call starts, call ends, analytics ready. Use them to trigger workflows, update CRMs, create tickets, or feed data pipelines.

**Location:** Left Sidebar → Agent Settings → Webhook tab

---

## How It Works

1. **Event occurs** (call starts, call ends, etc.)
2. **Atoms sends HTTP POST** to your endpoint with event data
3. **Your server processes** the data and takes action

---

## Configuration

### Select Endpoint

Choose from your configured webhook endpoints.

<Note>
**Create endpoints first.** Go to Features → Webhooks to set up endpoints before you can select them here.
</Note>

### Subscribe to Events

| Event | When It Fires | What's Included |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Start** | Call begins | Caller info, agent info, timestamp |
| **End** | Call ends | Full transcript, duration, outcome |
| **Analytics Completed** | Post-call analysis done | Metrics, scores, extracted data |
