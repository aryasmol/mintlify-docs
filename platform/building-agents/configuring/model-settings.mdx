Model Settings control how the AI behaves — the model powering responses, language handling, and formatting preferences. The options vary slightly depending on your agent type.

**Location:** Left Sidebar → Agent Settings → Model tab

## What's Different by Agent Type

    Single Prompt agents have:
    - AI Model (LLM Model + Language)
    - Speech Formatting
    - Language Switching
    
    The prompt itself lives in the Prompt Section (top of editor).

    Conversational Flow agents have everything above, plus:
    - **Global Prompt** — Set personality and behavior instructions
    - **Knowledge Base** — Connect reference material

## AI Model

Choose the LLM powering your agent and its primary language.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **LLM Model** | The AI model (Electron, GPT-4o, etc.) |
| **Language** | Primary language for responses |

For Single Prompt agents, you can also set the model in the [Prompt Section](/platform/building-agents/configuring/model-selection) dropdown.

---

## Speech Formatting

When enabled (default: ON), Speech Formatting automatically applies additional formatting to transcripts to improve readability — including punctuation, paragraphs, and entity formatting like dates, times, and numbers.

---

## Language Switching

Enable your agent to switch languages mid-conversation based on what the caller speaks (default: ON).

### Advanced Settings

When Language Switching is enabled, you can fine-tune how the agent detects language changes:

| Setting | Range | Default | What it does |
|---------|-------|---------|--------------|
| **Minimum Words for Detection** | 1-10 | 2 | How many words before considering a language switch |
| **Strong Signal Threshold** | 0-1 | 0.7 | Confidence level for immediate switch |
| **Weak Signal Threshold** | 0-1 | 0.3 | Confidence level for tentative detection |
| **Consecutive Weak Signals** | 1-8 | 2 | How many weak signals needed to switch |

**Understanding the thresholds:**

- **Strong Signal:** The AI is very confident the caller switched languages → switches immediately.
- **Weak Signal:** The AI is somewhat confident → waits for more evidence.
- **Higher thresholds** = More certain before switching (reduces false switches)
- **Lower thresholds** = Quicker to switch (more responsive, but may false-trigger)

For most cases, the defaults work well. Adjust only if you're seeing unwanted switching behavior.

## Global Prompt (Conversational Flow Only)

Set global instructions for your agent's personality and behavior. This applies across all nodes in your flow (limit: 4,000 characters).

Use this to define:
- Personality traits ("friendly and professional")
- Behavioral guidelines ("always confirm before transferring")
- Consistent phrasing or style
- Company-specific instructions

<Note>
This is only available for Conversational Flow agents. Single Prompt agents define everything in their [main prompt](/platform/building-agents/single-prompt/writing-prompts).
</Note>

---

## Knowledge Base (Conversational Flow Only)

Connect a knowledge base to enhance your agent's responses with reference material.

Click the dropdown to select from your existing knowledge bases, or leave as "No Knowledge Base" if not needed.

<Note>
Single Prompt agents connect knowledge bases via the [Configuration Panel](/platform/building-agents/configuring/knowledge-base) instead.
