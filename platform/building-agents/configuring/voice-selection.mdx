Your agent's voice is often the first thing callers notice. It sets the tone before a single word of your prompt matters. A voice that fits your brand builds immediate trust — one that doesn't can undermine even the best conversation design.

**Location:** Prompt Section (top bar) → Voice dropdown

<Note>
The Prompt Section is only available for **Single Prompt agents**. Conversational Flow agents configure voices in [Agent Settings → Voice tab](/platform/building-agents/configuring/voice-settings).

## Finding the Right Voice

Click the Voice dropdown to open the picker. You'll see:

| Section | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Search** | Find voices by name or characteristic |
| **Filters** | Narrow by language, accent, age, gender, or model type |
| **Currently Used** | Your selected voice at the top |
| **All Voices** | The full library to browse |

Take your time here. Filter by the language you need, then explore. Every voice has a personality — some are warm and reassuring, others confident and direct.

<Tip>
**Always preview.** Click the ▶️ button next to any voice to hear a sample. Listen with your prompt in mind — does this voice sound like the agent you've written?
