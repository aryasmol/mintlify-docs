End Call tells your agent when to hang up. Without proper end conditions, calls may drag on awkwardly or never conclude. Define clear triggers so conversations wrap up naturally.

**Location:** Config Panel (right sidebar) → End Call toggle

---

## Setup

1. Toggle **End Call** ON
2. Click the ⚙️ icon to open settings
3. Click **+ Add End Call** to create a function

---

## Configuration

<Frame caption="Add End Call modal">
  ![Add end call](/platform/building-agents/images/end-call-modal.png)
</Frame>

Each end call function has two fields:

| Field | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Name** | Identifier (used internally) | `end_call_resolved` |
| **Description** | Tells the AI when to trigger | "End the call when the customer confirms their issue is resolved" |

The Description is critical — it's what the AI uses to decide when to end the call. Be specific.

## Tips

<Accordion title="Be explicit about triggers">
  | Vague | Specific |
  |-------|----------|
  | "When done" | "When customer confirms satisfaction" |
  | "If goodbye" | "When customer says goodbye, thanks, or indicates they're finished" |
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Cover edge cases">
  Don't just handle the happy path:
  
  - Customer explicitly asks to end
  - Customer becomes unresponsive after 3 prompts
  - Customer requests callback instead
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Stay consistent with your prompt">
  If your main prompt says "end when resolved," your end call description should match that language.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Create multiple functions">
  Think through every way a call might conclude:
  
  | Function | Scenario |
  |----------|----------|
  | `end_resolved` | Issue fixed, customer happy |
  | `end_goodbye` | Customer says goodbye |
  | `end_transfer` | After transferring |
  | `end_no_response` | Caller stopped responding |
  | `end_out_of_scope` | Can't help, directed elsewhere |
</Accordion>
