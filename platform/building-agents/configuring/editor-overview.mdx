The editor is where your agent comes to life. It's the workspace you'll return to every time you want to tweak behavior, adjust settings, or test a new approach. Understanding the layout means you'll always know exactly where to go.

This page walks you through every part of the interface — what each area does, why you'd use it, and where to dive deeper.

## The Header

At the very top, you'll find navigation and identification.

<Frame caption="Editor header">
  ![Editor header](/platform/building-agents/images/editor-header.png)
</Frame>

**← Back arrow** takes you to your agents list. Use it when you're done editing or want to switch to a different agent.

**Agent name** is clickable — rename your agent anytime. Pick something meaningful; you'll thank yourself when you have twenty agents.

**Agent ID** is the unique identifier for API calls and integrations. Click to copy it.

## The Prompt Section

This bar runs across the top and controls the fundamentals: which AI model powers your agent, what voice it speaks with, and what language it uses.

<Frame caption="The Prompt Section">
  ![Prompt section](/platform/building-agents/images/prompt-section.png)
</Frame>

These three choices shape the foundation of your agent's personality:

- **Model** determines intelligence and capability. GPT-4o is recommended for most cases.
- **Voice** is what callers hear. Preview voices before choosing — the right voice builds trust instantly.
- **Language** sets the primary language for responses. Multi-language support is configured separately.

## The Prompt Editor

The center of the screen is where you write. This is your agent's brain — the instructions that define who it is, what it knows, and how it behaves.

<Frame caption="The Prompt Editor">
  ![Prompt editor](/platform/building-agents/images/prompt-editor.png)
</Frame>

Everything flows from what you write here. A good prompt covers identity, knowledge, behavior guidelines, and end conditions. You'll refine it over time based on real conversations.

## The Configuration Panel

The right sidebar holds your agent's capabilities — the tools it can use beyond just talking.

<Frame caption="Configuration Panel">
  ![Config panel](/platform/building-agents/images/config-panel.png)
</Frame>

Each toggle enables a feature:

**End Call** defines when and how your agent hangs up. Without this, calls may never end gracefully.

**Transfer Call** lets your agent hand off to humans — either immediately (cold) or with a briefing (warm).

**Knowledge Base** connects reference documents your agent can search during conversations.

**Variables** enable personalization with dynamic values — caller names, account details, collected information.

**API Calls** let your agent fetch and send data mid-conversation — look up orders, check availability, create tickets.

## The Left Sidebar

This is your navigation between different configuration areas.

<Frame caption="Left sidebar navigation">
  ![Left sidebar](/platform/building-agents/images/left-sidebar.png)
</Frame>

**Prompt** brings you back to the main editor (where you are now in Single Prompt agents).

**Agent Settings** opens detailed configuration tabs — voice tuning, model behavior, webhooks, and timeouts. This is where fine-tuning happens.

**Widget** configures the embeddable web widget if you want callers to reach your agent from your website.

**Integrations** connects third-party services like Salesforce directly, without custom API work.

**Post Call Metrics** defines what data gets extracted from calls automatically — satisfaction scores, outcomes, categories.

## The Action Buttons

Top right corner — the buttons you'll use constantly.

<Frame caption="Action buttons">
  ![Action buttons](/platform/building-agents/images/action-buttons.png)
</Frame>

**Convo Logs** shows transcripts of every conversation your agent has had. Essential for debugging and improvement.

**Lock Agent** prevents accidental edits. Turn this on for production agents. You can still test locked agents.

**Test Agent** is how you try your agent before deploying. Choose from phone call, web call, or text chat.

→ [Testing Your Agent](/platform/building-agents/testing-launch/testing) · [Conversation Logs](/platform/building-agents/testing-launch/conversation-logs) · [Locking Agents](/platform/building-agents/testing-launch/locking)

## For Conversational Flow Agents

If you're building a Conversational Flow agent instead of Single Prompt, the layout changes slightly.

<Frame caption="Conversational Flow editor">
  ![Convo Flow editor](/platform/building-agents/images/cf-editor-full.png)
</Frame>

The center becomes a visual canvas where you design workflows with nodes and branches. A **Workflow/Settings toggle** at the top switches between the flow builder and configuration options.

The left panel becomes a **Node Palette** for dragging conversation steps onto the canvas.

Everything else — action buttons, left sidebar navigation, agent settings — works the same way.

## Saving Your Work

Most changes save automatically as you make them. When they don't, a footer appears: **"You have unsaved changes"** with Discard and Save buttons. Always save before navigating away.
