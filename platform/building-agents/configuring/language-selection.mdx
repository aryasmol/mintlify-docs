This sets the language your agent speaks by default. Simple as that.

**Location:** Prompt Section (top bar) → Language dropdown

<Note>
The Prompt Section is only available for **Single Prompt agents**. Conversational Flow agents configure language in [Agent Settings → Model tab](/platform/building-agents/configuring/model-settings).
</Note>

## How It Works

Click the dropdown, pick your language. The options you see depend on which voice you've selected — different voices support different languages. If you don't see the language you need, try a different voice first.

<Tip>
**Need multi-language support?** If your agent should switch languages mid-conversation based on what the caller speaks, configure that in [Model Settings](/platform/building-agents/configuring/model-settings).
