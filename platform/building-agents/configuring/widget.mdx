The widget lets visitors talk to your agent without leaving your site — no phone call needed. They can either text or speak, right from their browser.

**Location:** Left Sidebar → Widget

## Embed Code

At the top, you'll find your embed snippet. Copy this and paste it into your website's HTML.

```html
<atoms-widget assistant-id="YOUR_AGENT_ID"></atoms-widget>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/atoms-widget-core@latest/dist/embed/widget.umd.js"></script>
```

That's it — the widget will appear on your site. Everything else on this page customizes how it looks and behaves.

---

## Mode

Choose how users interact with your widget:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Chat** | Users type messages. Good for quieter environments or when voice isn't practical. |
| **Voice** | Users speak directly. The full voice agent experience in the browser. |

Pick based on your audience. Voice feels more natural for most support scenarios. Chat works better for quick questions or when users might be in public.

---

## Allowlist

By default, any website can embed your widget. That's convenient for testing, but risky for production.

<Warning>
**Set up an allowlist** before going live. Without one, anyone could embed your agent on their site, potentially running up your usage or misrepresenting your brand.
</Warning>

Click **+ Add host** to specify which domains can use your widget:

```
yourdomain.com
app.yourdomain.com
```

Only these sites will be able to load the widget.

## Appearance

### Variant

How much screen space should the widget take?

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Tiny">
    <Frame caption="Tiny variant">
      ![Tiny widget](/platform/building-agents/images/widget-tiny.png)
    </Frame>
    
    Minimal footprint. Just a small button that expands when clicked. Best when you want the widget available but unobtrusive.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Compact">
    <Frame caption="Compact variant">
      ![Compact widget](/platform/building-agents/images/widget-compact.png)
    </Frame>
    
    Balanced size. Visible enough to invite interaction, but doesn't dominate the page. Good default for most sites.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Full">
    <Frame caption="Full variant">
      ![Full widget](/platform/building-agents/images/widget-full-variant.png)
    </Frame>
    
    Prominent and hard to miss. Use when the widget is a primary way users should interact with your site.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Placement

Where the widget button appears on screen. Currently supports **Bottom-right**.

<Note>
The preview on this page always shows bottom-right. The placement you choose applies when embedded on your actual site.

## Theme

Make the widget match your brand.

| Setting | What it affects | Default |
|---------|-----------------|---------|
| **Widget Background Color** | Main widget background | `#ffffff` |
| **Brand Accent Color** | Buttons, highlights | `#2d9d9f` |
| **Agent Message Background** | Agent response bubbles | `#f3f4f6` |
| **Text on Accent Color** | Text on accent-colored elements | `#FFFFFF` |
| **Primary Text Color** | Main text | `#111827` |
| **Secondary Text Color** | Subtitles, hints | `#6b7280` |

Click any color to open a picker, or paste a hex code directly.

---

## Avatar

Upload an image to represent your agent in the widget. This appears in the chat interface and helps humanize the experience.

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Recommended size** | 172px × 172px |
| **Maximum file size** | 2MB |
| **Format** | PNG, JPG |

Drag and drop or click to upload.

---

## Text Contents

Customize the copy users see.

| Field | What it controls | Default |
|-------|------------------|---------|
| **Start Button Text** | Button to begin conversation | "Start" |
| **End Button Text** | Button to end conversation | "End" |
| **Chat Placeholder** | Input field placeholder | "Type your message..." |
| **CTA Name** (optional) | Call-to-action text on widget button | "Talk to Atoms" |
| **Widget Name** (optional) | Name displayed in widget header | "Atoms" |

Make these match your brand voice. "Chat with us" feels different than "Get help" or "Ask a question."

---

## Terms & Conditions

If you need users to agree to terms before using the widget, enable **Require consent**.

When enabled, users see a checkbox they must tick before starting. This is useful for:
- GDPR compliance
- Recording consent
- Specific terms of service

---

## Preview

As you make changes, the widget preview updates in real-time in the bottom-right corner of the page. Test different settings before deploying.
