## Configuration Options

<Frame caption="Left panel configuration options">

</Frame>

The left panel controls your agent's foundation:

### Agent Type

<Frame caption="Agent type dropdown">
  [IMAGE: Dropdown showing Single Prompt and Conversational Flow options]
</Frame>

| Type | What AI Generates |
|------|-------------------|
| **Single Prompt** | One comprehensive prompt |
| **Conversational Flow** | Complete workflow with nodes and branches |

### Call Direction

<Frame caption="Call direction dropdown">
  [IMAGE: Dropdown showing Inbound and Outbound options]
</Frame>

| Direction | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|
| **Inbound** | Agent receives calls (support, inquiries) |
| **Outbound** | Agent makes calls (campaigns, reminders) |

### Emotive Model

<Frame caption="Emotive model toggle">

<Note>
**Beta Feature:** Emotive models use speech-to-speech technology for more natural, emotionally-aware responses. Experimental but impressive.
</Note>

### Voice Selection

## The Four Prompts

<Frame caption="Right panel showing all four prompt fields">
  [IMAGE: Right side with four text areas stacked]
</Frame>

Each prompt shapes a different aspect of your agent. All require **minimum 50 characters**.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="1. Role & Objective">
    <Frame caption="Role & Objective field">
      [IMAGE: First prompt field highlighted]
    </Frame>
    
    **What it defines:** Who the agent is and what it's trying to accomplish.
    
    **Label:** "Provide the role & objective of your agent"
    
    **Good example:**
    ```
    You are a friendly and confident customer support agent for 
    a fintech platform. Your goal is to quickly understand the 
    user's issue, respond with empathy, and provide clear, 
    step-by-step solutions that make them feel heard and supported.
    
    Maintain a calm and reassuring tone throughout the conversation, 
    ensuring that the user feels confident in your assistance. Only 
    mark the issue as resolved once the user has confirmed they are 
    fully satisfied with the outcome.
    ```
    
    **Tips:**
    - Be specific about personality (friendly, professional, casual)
    - State the primary goal clearly
    - Mention the industry/context
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="2. Conversational Flow">
    <Frame caption="Conversational Flow field">
      [IMAGE: Second prompt field highlighted]
    </Frame>
    
    **What it defines:** The step-by-step conversation structure.
    
    **Label:** "Provide conversational flow that the agent should follow"
    
    **Good example:**
    ```
    As a NorthLoop Support agent, greet customers warmly and 
    confirm they are NorthLoop customers. Ask one focused question 
    to identify if the issue is billing or connectivity.
    
    For connectivity, get the service address; for billing, collect 
    the email or phone number. Verify the account and, if needed, 
    try an alternate identifier.
    
    Diagnose the issue: check for outages first, then guide through 
    reboot or cabling steps. If the outage lasted over four hours, 
    issue a refund. If local fixes fail, schedule a technician.
    
    Confirm resolution and next steps, invite questions, and close 
    politely.
    ```
    
    **Tips:**
    - Describe the conversation as a journey
    - Include decision points (if X, then Y)
    - Cover the main paths callers will take
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="3. Dos, Don'ts & Fallbacks">
    <Frame caption="Dos, Don'ts & Fallbacks field">
      [IMAGE: Third prompt field highlighted]
    </Frame>
    
    **What it defines:** Behavioral guardrails and edge case handling.
    
    **Label:** "Set your agent's dos, don'ts, and fallback behaviours — especially for edge cases or sensitive situations"
    
    **Good example:**
    ```
    Your agent should always remain calm, polite, and solution-oriented.
    
    DO:
    - Listen actively and show empathy
    - Provide clear next steps at every stage
    - Confirm understanding before proceeding
    - Escalate politely when needed
    
    DON'T:
    - Make assumptions about the issue
    - Overpromise on timelines or resolutions
    - Share unverified information
    - Rush the customer
    
    FALLBACKS:
    - Account lookup failures → Offer alternate verification methods
    - Incomplete verification → Politely re-request information
    - Unclear issues → Ask clarifying questions, don't guess
    - System limitations → Acknowledge honestly and offer alternatives
    
    Always prioritize accuracy, empathy, and clarity over speed.
    ```
    
    **Tips:**
    - List specific behaviors, not vague goals
    - Cover sensitive scenarios (angry callers, edge cases)
    - Define what to do when things go wrong
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="4. End Conditions">
    <Frame caption="End Conditions field">
      [IMAGE: Fourth prompt field highlighted]
    </Frame>
    
    **What it defines:** When and how the conversation should end.
    
    **Label:** "Specify the conditions under which the call should end"
    
    **Good example:**
    ```
    End the call when:
    
    1. Issue fully resolved and customer confirms satisfaction
       - Thank them for calling
       - Offer additional help before closing
    
    2. Customer requests to end the call
       - Acknowledge and close gracefully
       - Offer callback if issue unresolved
    
    3. Successful transfer to human agent
       - Confirm transfer is happening
       - Brief goodbye
    
    4. Customer becomes unresponsive
       - After 3 attempts to re-engage
       - Leave callback information
    
    5. Issue outside scope
       - Acknowledge limitation
       - Provide alternative resources
       - End with helpful next steps
    ```
    
    **Tips:**
    - Cover all the ways a call might end
    - Include what to say in each scenario
    - Don't forget edge cases (no response, wrong department)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Tips for Single Prompt Agents

When generating Single Prompt agents:

<Accordion title="Focus on personality and knowledge">
  Since there's no visual flow, the prompt needs to cover everything the agent should know and how it should behave.
  
  Include:
  - Detailed role description
  - All topics it should handle
  - Communication style
  - Edge case handling
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Be comprehensive in conversation flow">
  Even without visual nodes, describe the typical conversation arc:
  
  ```
  Start with a warm greeting. Ask how you can help. 
  Listen to the issue. Acknowledge and confirm understanding.
  Provide the solution or collect needed information.
  Confirm resolution. Offer additional help. Close warmly.
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Define flexibility">
  Single Prompt agents should handle topic jumps gracefully:
  
  ```
  If the customer changes topics, acknowledge the shift and 
  adapt. Don't force them back to previous subjects.
  ```
</Accordion>

---

## Tips for Conversational Flow Agents

When generating Conversational Flow agents:

<Accordion title="Describe explicit branches">
  Tell the AI exactly when paths should split:
  
  ```
  After greeting, ask if calling about billing or technical.
  
  BILLING PATH:
  - Verify account
  - Ask about specific charge
  - Explain or process refund
  
  TECHNICAL PATH:
  - Identify product
  - Troubleshoot steps
  - Schedule technician if needed
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Specify data collection">
  List what information must be gathered and when:
  
  ```
  Must collect before qualifying:
  1. Company name
  2. Company size (employees)
  3. Current solution
  4. Budget range
  5. Decision timeline
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Define all endings">
  Every path needs a conclusion:
  
  ```
  End points:
  - Qualified lead → Transfer to sales with context
  - Not qualified → Send resources, end call
  - Requested callback → Schedule and confirm
  - Angry customer → Escalate to manager
  ```
</Accordion>
