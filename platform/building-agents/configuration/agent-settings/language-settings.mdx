Language settings control what language your agent speaks and understands. Get this right and conversations feel natural. Get it wrong and callers struggle to communicate.

## Primary Language

Set the primary language during agent creation or in settings. This affects:

**Speech Recognition**
What language the system expects to hear from callers. Optimized for the accents and vocabulary of that language.

**Text-to-Speech**
What language the agent speaks in. Pronunciation, rhythm, and intonation are tuned for that language.

**LLM Processing**
The language context the AI uses when understanding and generating responses.

## Multi-Language Support

For agents that need to handle multiple languages:

### Language Detection

Enable automatic language detection. The agent listens to the first few seconds and switches to match the caller's language.

### Language Switching

You can design flows that explicitly ask about language preference:

```
"Hello! Para español, diga 'español'. For English, say 'English'."
```

Then route to language-specific nodes or prompts.

## Language in Prompts

Write prompts in the language your agent will speak. If your agent speaks Spanish, write your prompts in Spanish:

```
Hola, soy María del servicio al cliente de TechStore. 
¿En qué puedo ayudarte hoy?
```

The LLM understands prompts in most languages and responds appropriately.

<Accordion title="Best Practices">
**Test with native speakers.** Automated testing catches errors, but native speakers catch awkward phrasing and cultural mismatches.

**Consider regional variants.** Spanish in Mexico sounds different from Spanish in Spain. Choose the variant that matches your audience.

**Keep translations consistent.** If you support multiple languages, maintain the same quality across all of them. A great English experience with a bad Spanish translation frustrates bilingual customers.

**Handle code-switching.** Some callers mix languages ("Spanglish"). Decide whether your agent should match this or stick to one language.
