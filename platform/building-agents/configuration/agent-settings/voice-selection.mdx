Voice is the first thing callers notice. Before they hear what your agent says, they hear *how* it says it. A warm, natural voice builds trust. A robotic voice makes people hang up.

Atoms offers a range of high-quality voices optimized for real-time phone conversations.

## Choosing a Voice

When creating or editing an agent, you'll find voice selection in the agent settings. Click to browse available voices and preview each one before choosing.

### What to Consider

**Match your brand**
A luxury concierge service needs a different voice than a tech support line. Think about your brand's personality — formal or casual? Energetic or calm?

**Match your audience**
Consider who's calling. Different demographics respond to different voice characteristics.

**Match the use case**
- **Customer support** — Calm, patient, reassuring
- **Sales** — Energetic, confident, engaging
- **Healthcare** — Warm, empathetic, professional
- **Financial services** — Authoritative, trustworthy, clear

### Available Voice Characteristics

| Characteristic | Options |
|----------------|---------|
| **Gender** | Male, Female |
| **Tone** | Professional, Friendly, Casual, Authoritative |
| **Energy** | Calm, Neutral, Upbeat |
| **Accent** | American, British, Australian, Indian, and more |

## Voice Quality

All voices on Atoms are powered by **Waves**, our text-to-speech engine optimized for real-time telephony. This means:

**Ultra-low latency**
Responses start playing immediately. No awkward pauses while audio generates.

**Natural prosody**
Voices emphasize words naturally, pause appropriately, and sound human — not robotic.

**Phone-optimized**
Audio is tuned for phone call quality, not podcast production. It sounds clear over phone networks.

## Premium Voices

Some voices are marked as Premium and may have additional per-minute costs. Premium voices typically offer:
- More natural intonation
- Better handling of complex sentences
- Enhanced emotional range

Check the pricing page for current Premium voice rates.

## Voice Cloning (Enterprise)

**Preview with your actual prompts.** The same voice sounds different saying "Welcome to Acme Support" vs "Your payment of $1,247.83 is due tomorrow."

**Test on actual phone calls.** Browser preview sounds different than phone audio. Make test calls before deploying.

**Consider multilingual needs.** If your agent handles multiple languages, make sure your chosen voice supports them well.

**Get feedback.** Play sample calls for colleagues or customers. What sounds good to you might not resonate with your audience.
