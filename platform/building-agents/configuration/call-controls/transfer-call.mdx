Sometimes AI isn't enough. Complex issues, upset customers, high-value opportunities, or regulatory requirements may need a human touch. Transfer call settings control how your agent hands conversations to people.

---

## When to Transfer

Common transfer scenarios:

**Escalation requests**
Caller explicitly asks to speak with a person: "Let me talk to a real human."

**Complex issues**
Problems the AI can't solve: technical issues outside scope, edge cases, account-specific problems requiring manual intervention.

**High-value opportunities**
Sales conversations that need closing by a human: qualified leads, large deals, hesitant buyers who need persuasion.

**Compliance requirements**
Certain topics may legally require human handling: financial advice, medical diagnoses, legal matters.

**Caller frustration**
When a caller is upset and the AI isn't helping: "This is ridiculous, I've already explained this three times."

## Configuring Transfers

### Transfer Destination

Where the call goes:

| Type | Format | Use Case |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Phone Number** | +1-555-123-4567 | Direct line to support team |
| **SIP Address** | sip:support@company.com | VoIP system |
| **Queue** | sales-queue | Call center routing |

### Hold Experience

What the caller experiences while waiting:

**Hold Message**
What the caller hears while waiting to connect:
```
"I'm connecting you with a specialist now. 
Please hold for just a moment."
```

**Hold Music**
Background audio during the transfer. Keep it professional and not too long — transfers should be quick.

**Estimated Wait**
If known, tell callers how long they'll wait: "Your estimated wait time is about 2 minutes."

### Whisper Message

What the human agent hears *before* connecting (the caller doesn't hear this):

```
Incoming transfer from AI assistant.
Customer: John Smith
Account: Premium
Issue: Billing dispute - claims overcharge of $45
Previous attempts: AI tried to explain charges, customer not satisfied
```

Whisper messages give context so humans don't start from scratch.

## Transfer in Single Prompt Agents

Configure transfer behavior in your prompt's Dos and Don'ts section:

```
When to transfer:
- Caller explicitly requests a human agent
- Issue involves account security changes
- Caller mentions legal action or regulatory complaints
- You've failed to resolve the issue after 2 attempts

When transferring:
- Apologize briefly for not being able to help directly
- Tell them what's about to happen
- Stay warm and professional
```

Then configure the transfer destination in the agent settings panel.

## Transfer in Convo Flow Agents

Use **Transfer Call** nodes in your workflow:

1. Drag a Transfer Call node onto the canvas
2. Configure the destination, hold message, and whisper
3. Connect branches that should lead to transfer

Create branches for different transfer scenarios:
- "User requests human" → Transfer to support
- "User mentions legal" → Transfer to compliance
- "High-value lead" → Transfer to sales

## Transfer Failures

What happens when transfer fails — busy line, no answer, technical issue:

### Fallback Options

| Option | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| **Voicemail** | "I'll transfer you to voicemail so you can leave a message." |
| **Callback** | "Our team is busy. Can we call you back within the hour?" |
| **Alternate Number** | "Let me try another line..." |
| **Retry** | Attempt transfer again after brief hold |

### Graceful Handling

```
"I'm having trouble reaching the team right now. 
Would you prefer to leave a callback number, 
or should I try again in a moment?"
```

Never leave callers hanging. Always have a backup plan.

<Accordion title="Best Practices">
**Set expectations before transferring.** Tell callers what's happening, where they're going, and roughly how long it might take.

**Use whisper messages effectively.** A well-crafted whisper saves time and prevents callers from repeating themselves.

**Monitor transfer rates.** If too many calls transfer, your AI might not be configured well. Investigate why and improve the prompt.

**Keep hold times short.** Long holds after "let me transfer you" frustrate callers. If your team can't answer quickly, offer callbacks.

**Train your human team.** Make sure they know calls are coming from an AI agent and how to pick up the context from whisper messages.
