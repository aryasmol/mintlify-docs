Every call needs to end eventually. How it ends matters — a graceful conclusion leaves callers satisfied, while an abrupt cutoff frustrates them.

End call settings control when your agent concludes conversations and what happens when it does.

---

## How End Call Works

### In Single Prompt Agents

End call behavior is defined in your prompt's "End Call Conditions" section. You write natural language rules:

```
End the call when:
- Customer confirms their issue is resolved
- Customer explicitly asks to end the call
- Customer says they have no more questions
```

The AI interprets these conditions and ends the call when appropriate.

### In Convo Flow Agents

You explicitly place **End Call** nodes in your workflow. When the conversation reaches one of these nodes, the call ends.

```
Confirmation → End Call (Disposition: Successful)
Not Interested → End Call (Disposition: Unsuccessful)
```

## Configuring End Behavior

### Farewell Message

What the agent says before hanging up. Make it warm and professional:

```
Thanks for calling TechStore! We hope we were able to help. 
Have a wonderful day!
```

Avoid abrupt endings like "Goodbye" followed by immediate disconnection.

### Disposition Tagging

Tag call outcomes for analytics:

| Disposition | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| **Successful** | Goal achieved — booking made, question answered, issue resolved |
| **Unsuccessful** | Goal not achieved — not interested, couldn't help, wrong number |
| **Transferred** | Handed off to a human agent |
| **Voicemail** | Left a message (outbound only) |
| **No Answer** | Caller didn't pick up (outbound only) |
| **Callback Requested** | Caller asked for a follow-up call |

Dispositions appear in your analytics and help measure agent performance.

## Automatic End Conditions

Beyond explicit end triggers, calls can end automatically:

### Silence Timeout

If the caller stops responding for too long, the agent should handle it gracefully:

```
"Hello? Are you still there?"
[Wait 5 seconds]
"I haven't heard from you, so I'll let you go. 
Feel free to call back if you need anything!"
```

Configure the timeout duration and the agent's response.

### Max Call Duration

Set a maximum call length as a safety net. Very long calls may indicate the conversation is stuck or the caller is not engaging productively.

### Error Conditions

What happens if something breaks — API failure, voice synthesis error, etc. Configure fallback behavior:

```
"I'm experiencing a technical issue. Let me transfer you to someone who can help."
```

---

## Post-Call Actions

After a call ends, you can trigger actions:

**CRM Updates**
Log the call outcome, duration, and summary to your CRM.

**Follow-up Emails**
Send confirmation emails or summaries to the caller.

**Ticket Creation**
Create support tickets for unresolved issues.

**Analytics**
Track custom metrics and conversion events.

In Convo Flow agents, use **Post-Call API** nodes for these actions. In Single Prompt agents, configure them in the integrations panel.

<Accordion title="Best Practices">
**Always give a proper goodbye.** Even if the caller says "thanks, bye" quickly, have the agent say something warm before disconnecting.

**Don't end too early.** Make sure your conditions don't trigger on partial confirmations. "Yeah, I think so" isn't the same as "Yes, I'm all set."

**Don't end too late.** If the caller clearly wants to go, let them. Repeated "is there anything else?" after they've said goodbye is annoying.

**Handle silence gracefully.** Background noise, thinking pauses, and distractions happen. Give callers a chance before assuming they're gone.

**Tag dispositions accurately.** Good analytics depend on honest categorization. Don't mark failed calls as successful.
