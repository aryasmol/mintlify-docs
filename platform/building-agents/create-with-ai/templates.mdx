Templates provide pre-written prompts for common use cases. Instead of starting from scratch, you can use a template as a foundation and customize it for your needs.

## Customizing Templates

Templates are starting points. Always customize:

### Replace Placeholder Content

Templates use generic names like "[Company Name]" or "[Product]". Replace these with your actual information.

### Adjust Procedures

Your processes may differ from the template. Update steps to match how your team actually works.

### Add Specifics

Templates are generic by design. Add:
- Your specific products/services
- Your pricing (if applicable)
- Your escalation procedures
- Your verification requirements

### Remove Irrelevant Sections

If a template includes something you don't need, remove it. Simpler is often better.

## Clear All Button

If you've selected a template but want to start fresh:

1. Find the **"Clear All"** button
2. Click to reset all four prompts to blank
3. Start writing from scratch or choose a different template

## Best Practices

### Choose the Closest Match

If no template is perfect, choose the closest one. It's easier to modify existing content than start from nothing.

### Test Before Deploying

Template-based agents still need testing. Run through conversations to verify the generated agent works for your use case.

### Iterate

Your first version won't be perfect. Use conversation logs to identify issues and refine the prompts.
