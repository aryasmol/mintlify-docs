## Agent Type

Choose what type of agent the AI will generate:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Single prompt** | AI generates one comprehensive prompt for flexible conversations |
| **Conversational flow** | AI creates a visual workflow with nodes and branches |

**How to choose:**
- Single prompt → Open-ended, flexible conversations
- Conversational flow → Structured, goal-oriented conversations

---

## Call Direction

Define whether this agent receives or makes calls:

| Direction | Description | Use Cases |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Inbound** | Agent receives calls from customers | Support, FAQ, orders |
| **Outbound** | Agent makes calls to customers | Reminders, campaigns, follow-ups |

This affects how the AI generates the opening of conversations:
- Inbound: Agent answers and greets caller
- Outbound: Agent initiates and introduces purpose

---

## Emotive Model (Beta)

Toggle to enable speech-to-speech AI with emotional expression.

| State | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **OFF** | Standard text-to-speech, consistent tone |
| **ON** | Emotive model with natural emotional variation |

**When to use Emotive Model:**
- Conversations requiring warmth and empathy
- Sales calls needing enthusiasm
- Support calls needing patience

**Considerations:**
- Beta feature — may have quirks
- More natural sounding
- Slightly higher latency possible

---

## Voice Selection

Choose the voice your agent will use.

Clicking the dropdown opens the voice picker:
- Search by language, accent
- Filter by gender, age, model
- Preview voices before selecting

**Tip:** Choose a voice that matches your brand personality:
- Professional service → Clear, neutral voice
- Friendly support → Warm, approachable voice
- Sales → Energetic, confident voice

---

## Knowledge Base

Optionally attach a knowledge base for the agent to reference.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **None** | Agent relies only on prompt |
| **[Your KB]** | Agent can reference KB content |

**When to attach:**
- Agent needs to answer detailed questions
- You have FAQs, docs, or product info
- Accuracy from specific sources matters

**Note:** You must create a Knowledge Base first before it appears here. See [Knowledge Base](/platform/features/knowledge-base/what-is-kb) for setup.
