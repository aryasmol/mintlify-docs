Create with AI requires four prompts that define your agent's behavior. Each prompt focuses on a specific aspect, and together they create a complete picture for the AI to work from.

## Prompt 1: Role & Objective

**Label:** "Provide the role & objective of your agent*"

**Purpose:** Define who the agent is and what it's trying to achieve.

### What to Include

- Agent's identity/persona
- Company they represent
- Primary goal of conversations
- Tone and personality
- Key responsibilities

### Example

```
You are a friendly and confident customer support agent for a 
fintech platform. Your goal is to quickly understand the user's 
issue, respond with empathy, and provide clear, step-by-step 
solutions that make them feel heard and supported. Maintain a 
calm and reassuring tone throughout the conversation, ensuring 
that the user feels confident in your assistance. Only mark the 
issue as resolved once the user has confirmed they are fully 
satisfied with the outcome.
```

### Tips

- Be specific about personality ("friendly and confident" not just "helpful")
- State the goal clearly
- Include tone guidance

---

## Prompt 2: Conversational Flow

**Label:** "Provide conversational flow that the agent should follow*"

**Purpose:** Define the step-by-step structure of conversations.

### What to Include

- How to open conversations
- Key questions to ask
- Order of information gathering
- How to handle different scenarios
- When to provide what information

### Example

```
As a NorthLoop Support agent, greet customers warmly and confirm 
they are NorthLoop customers. Ask one focused question to identify 
if the issue is billing or connectivity. For connectivity, get the 
service address; for billing, collect the email or phone number. 
Verify the account and, if needed, try an alternate identifier. 
Diagnose the issue: check for outages first, then guide through 
reboot or cabling steps. If the outage lasted over four hours, 
issue a refund. If local fixes fail, schedule a technician. 
Confirm resolution and next steps, invite questions, and close 
politely.
```

### Tips

- Think step-by-step
- Cover different paths (billing vs. technical)
- Include resolution confirmation

---

## Prompt 3: Dos, Don'ts & Fallbacks

**Label:** "Set your agent's dos, don'ts, and fallback behaviours -- especially for edge cases or sensitive situations*"

**Purpose:** Define behavioral guardrails and edge case handling.

### What to Include

- Things the agent should always do
- Things the agent should never do
- How to handle difficult situations
- Escalation triggers
- Fallback responses

### Example

```
Your agent should always remain calm, polite, and solution-oriented. 
Do listen actively, show empathy, and provide clear next steps at 
every stage. Don't make assumptions, overpromise, or share 
unverified information. In edge cases like account lookup failures, 
incomplete verification, or unclear issues, fall back to offering 
general guidance, escalate politely when needed, and reassure the 
customer that their concern will be handled promptly. Always 
prioritize accuracy, empathy, and clarity over speed.
```

### Tips

- Be explicit about what NOT to do
- Include fallback behaviors
- Cover sensitive situations (angry customers, privacy)

---

## Prompt 4: End Conditions

**Label:** "Specify the conditions under which the call should end*"

**Purpose:** Define when and how conversations should conclude.

### What to Include

- Successful resolution triggers
- Customer-initiated endings
- Transfer completions
- Timeout/unresponsive handling
- Failed conversation handling

### Examples

```
Issue fully resolved and customer confirms satisfaction
```

```
Customer requests to end the call
```

```
Successful transfer to human agent completed
```

```
Customer becomes unresponsive after 3 attempts to re-engage
```

### Tips

- Cover positive endings (resolved)
- Cover neutral endings (customer done)
- Cover negative endings (can't help)
- Include unresponsive scenarios

---
