Create with AI accelerates agent building by generating prompts from your descriptions. Instead of writing everything from scratch, you describe what you want, and AI helps create it.

## Overview

Create with AI is a guided process that:

1. Takes your configuration choices (agent type, voice, etc.)
2. Accepts your descriptions of what the agent should do
3. Generates a complete agent based on your input
4. Delivers a fully customizable agent in the standard editor

Think of it as a smart starting point. You provide the requirements, AI does the heavy lifting, and you refine the result.

## The Process

### Step 1: Select Create with AI

From the "Create Agent" modal, click **"Create with AI"**.

### Step 2: Configure Left Panel

Set basic agent settings:
- Agent type (Single Prompt or Conversational Flow)
- Call direction (Inbound or Outbound)
- Voice selection
- Knowledge Base (optional)
- Emotive Model toggle (optional)

### Step 3: Fill Four Prompts (Right Panel)

Describe your agent across four sections:
1. **Role & Objective** — Who is the agent and what's the goal?
2. **Conversational Flow** — How should conversations progress?
3. **Dos, Don'ts & Fallbacks** — Behavioral guidelines
4. **End Conditions** — When should calls end?

Each prompt requires at least 50 characters.

### Step 4: Click Create

Click **"Create agent"** button.

### Step 5: Wait for Generation

A loading modal appears:

```
Hold up, your agent is getting ready

✅ Analyzing requirements
✅ Designing prompt  
⏳ Creating your agent
```

Generation takes about 30-60 seconds.

### Step 6: Review and Customize

After generation, you land in the standard agent editor. Everything is fully editable:
- Modify the generated prompt
- Adjust voice settings
- Add knowledge base
- Configure all options

---

## What Gets Generated

Depending on your agent type:

**Single Prompt Agent:**
- Complete prompt covering all four sections
- Voice and model configuration
- Ready for testing

**Conversational Flow Agent:**
- Visual workflow with nodes
- Prompts for each node
- Basic branching structure
- Ready for refinement

## Pro Tips

<Tip>
**Use caller context (like past tickets) to greet by name. Even a small touch of personalization boosts trust.**
</Tip>

### Be Specific in Descriptions

The more detail you provide, the better the output:

**Vague:** "Help customers with orders"

**Specific:** "Help customers track existing orders, process returns within 30 days, and answer questions about shipping times. Always verify the order number before providing details."

### Use Templates as Starting Points

If your use case is similar to a template, start there. Templates provide well-structured examples that AI can build on.

### Plan to Refine

AI generation is a starting point, not a final product. Expect to:
- Review and adjust prompts
- Test thoroughly
- Iterate based on conversations

---

## After Generation

Your agent is ready but not deployed. Next steps:

1. **Test** — Use Test Agent to verify behavior
2. **Refine** — Adjust prompts based on testing
3. **Configure** — Set up end call, transfers, webhooks
4. **Deploy** — Assign phone number or embed widget
