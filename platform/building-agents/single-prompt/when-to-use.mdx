Single Prompt agents are the simpler of the two agent types. They use one comprehensive prompt to guide all conversations, letting the AI handle the flow naturally. But they're not right for every situation.

---

## Ideal Use Cases

Single Prompt agents shine when conversations are **flexible and open-ended**:

### Customer FAQ Bots

Customers ask all kinds of questions. A Single Prompt agent can handle diverse topics naturally, moving between subjects as the conversation flows.

### General Product Information

When callers want to learn about your offerings, a Single Prompt agent can discuss features, pricing, and comparisons without rigid scripts.

### Basic Support Triage

For first-line support that identifies issues and provides general guidance before escalating, Single Prompt handles the variety well.

### Creative or Advisory Interactions

Conversations involving recommendations, advice, or creative problem-solving benefit from the flexible nature of Single Prompt.

### Simple Information Lookup

When callers need quick answers from a knowledge base — store hours, order status, basic policies — Single Prompt delivers naturally.

---

## Not Ideal For

Single Prompt agents struggle when you need **strict control over conversation flow**:

### Strict Multi-Step Workflows

If callers must complete steps in a specific order (collect info A, then B, then C), Conversational Flow gives you that control.

### Lead Qualification with Specific Criteria

When you need to score leads based on exact questions and route based on answers, the visual workflow of Conversational Flow is clearer.

### Appointment Booking with Complex Branching

Scheduling with multiple conditions (time slots, service types, locations) often needs the precision of defined paths.

### Compliance-Required Conversations

When regulations require specific disclosures in specific order, Conversational Flow ensures nothing is missed.

### Processes Requiring Exact Sequences

Any process where the order of steps matters more than natural conversation should use Conversational Flow.
