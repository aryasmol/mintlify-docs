### Step 1: Start Creation

The agent editor opens.

### Step 2: Understand the Layout

The editor has three main areas:

| Area | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Prompt Section** | Top bar | Model, Voice, Language dropdowns |
| **Prompt Editor** | Center | Write your agent's instructions |
| **Configuration Panel** | Right sidebar | End Call, Transfer, KB, Variables, API Calls |

### Step 3: Configure Basic Settings

**In the Prompt Section (top bar):**

1. **Model** — Select your LLM (GPT-4o recommended)
2. **Voice** — Choose from the voice library
3. **Language** — Set primary language

Click each dropdown to see options. For voices, use the play button to preview.

---

### Step 4: Write Your Prompt

In the center Prompt Editor, write instructions for your agent. A good prompt includes:

1. **Role** — Who is the agent?
2. **Objective** — What should it accomplish?
3. **Key Information** — What should it know?
4. **Guidelines** — How should it behave?
5. **End Conditions** — When should it end calls?

**Example Prompt:**

```
You are an agent which tells the users about Smallest.ai. 

Smallest.ai is a unified AI platform that specializes in real-time 
applications using small language models (SLMs). The company focuses 
on providing fast, efficient, and hyper-personalized AI solutions.

Key advantages to mention:
1. Small Models: Easier integrations and faster fine-tuning
2. Hyper Personalization: SLMs that actively learn from interactions
3. Minimal Latency: 100ms streaming responses
4. On Edge Deployment: Works from mobile to enterprise clouds
5. Low Cost: 10x cheaper than traditional large models

Be friendly, concise, and helpful. Keep responses under 30 words 
when possible. If you don't know something, say so honestly.
```

### Step 5: Configure Right Panel (Optional)

The Configuration Panel offers additional features:

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| End Call | Define when AI terminates calls |
| Transfer Call | Set up human handoffs |
