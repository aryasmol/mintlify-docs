This guide walks you through creating a working Single Prompt agent. By the end, you'll have an agent you can actually call and talk to.

---

## Step 1: Start Creating

From your dashboard, click **Create Agent** in the top-right corner.

</Frame>

---

## Step 2: Fill In Basic Details

A modal appears asking for basic information:

<Frame caption="Create Agent modal">
  <img src="/images/agent-modal.png" alt="Create Agent modal" />
</Frame>

| Field | What to Enter |
|-------|---------------|
| **Agent Name** | Something descriptive — "Customer Support Bot", "Sales Assistant", etc. |
| **Call Type** | **Inbound** if customers call in, **Outbound** if the agent makes calls |
| **Voice** | Click to preview voices, pick one that matches your brand |
| **Language** | Primary language for the conversation |

---

## Step 3: Select Agent Type

Choose **Single prompt agent** — it's marked as Recommended.

</Frame>

The other option, Conversational Flow, is for complex step-by-step workflows. Stick with Single Prompt for natural conversations.

---

## Step 4: Choose a Starting Point

You can start from scratch or use a template:

**Start from Scratch**
Select "Start with custom prompt" to write everything yourself. Best when you have specific requirements.

**Use a Template**
Pick a pre-built template for your industry — Healthcare, E-commerce, Banking, Sales, Real Estate. Templates give you a solid foundation that you can customize.

<Tip>
Templates save time. Even if your use case is unique, starting from a related template is often faster than writing from scratch.
</Tip>

## Step 5: Add Knowledge Base (Optional)

If you want your agent to reference specific information (product docs, policies, FAQs), connect a Knowledge Base now.

Click **Select knowledge base** and either choose an existing one or create new. The agent will search this content when answering questions.

You can skip this step and add it later.

---

## Step 6: Create the Agent

Click **Create agent** in the top-right. 

Atoms will process your configuration — this takes about 30 seconds. When complete, you'll see a success message.

Click **Go to Agent** to open the prompt editor.

---

## Step 7: Write Your Prompt

You're now in the main editor. The center area shows four prompt sections:

<Frame caption="The Single Prompt editor">

</Frame>

Fill in each section:

**Role & Objective**
Who your agent is and what it should accomplish.

```
You are Alex, a friendly customer support agent for TechStore.
Your goal is to help customers with orders, returns, and product questions.
```

**Conversation Flow**
How the agent should guide conversations.

```
1. Greet warmly and ask how you can help
2. Listen and understand their need
3. Provide helpful information or take action
4. Confirm they're satisfied
5. Ask if there's anything else
```

**Dos and Don'ts**
Behavioral guardrails.

```
DO: Be patient, confirm before making changes, offer to transfer if stuck
DON'T: Share other customers' info, make promises you can't keep
```

**End Call Conditions**
When to conclude the call.

```
End when: Issue resolved, customer requests it, or transferred successfully
```

## Step 8: Test Your Agent

Click **Test Agent** in the top bar. Make a test call and try different scenarios:

- Ask a normal question
- Ask something unexpected  
- Interrupt mid-response
- Try to get it to break a rule

Listen for how natural it sounds. Check that it follows your guidelines.
