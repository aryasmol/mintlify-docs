## Single Prompt AI Tips

When using Create with AI for Single Prompt agents:

<Accordion title="Be descriptive in Role & Objective">
  The more context you provide about the agent's purpose, the better the generated prompt.
  
  **Instead of:** "Customer support agent"
  
  **Try:** "A friendly customer support agent for a B2B software company that helps users with account issues, billing questions, and basic troubleshooting"
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Describe conversation style">
  Include personality traits in your description — the AI will weave them into the prompt.
  
  **Example:** "Warm and approachable, uses simple language, occasionally adds light humor"
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Mention key topics">
  List the main subjects your agent should handle. The AI will structure the prompt around these.
  
  **Example:** "Handles questions about pricing tiers, feature comparisons, trial extensions, and upgrade paths"
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Specify constraints">
  Tell the AI what the agent should NOT do — this creates important guardrails.
  
  **Example:** "Should never quote specific prices, always directs pricing questions to sales team"
</Accordion>
