    ```diff
    - You are a support agent for [Company].
    + You are a support agent for Acme Corporation.
    
    - Our support hours are [hours].
    + Our support hours are 9am-6pm EST.
    ```
    
    <Frame caption="Template with company placeholders">
      [IMAGE: Prompt with [Company] and [hours] placeholders visible]
    </Frame>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Policies & Info">
    Update with your actual business rules:
    
    ```diff
    - Returns accepted within [X] days.
    + Returns accepted within 30 days with receipt.
    
    - Shipping takes [X-X] business days.
    + Shipping takes 3-5 business days.
    ```
    
    <Frame caption="Policy section being customized">
      [IMAGE: Prompt section with policy text highlighted]
    </Frame>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Tone & Style">
    Adjust the personality to match your brand:

    + Be warm, friendly, and occasionally use casual language.

    ```

## Tips for Template Success

<Accordion title="Start with the closest match">
  Even if no template is perfect, pick the closest one. It's easier to modify an existing structure than start from nothing.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Keep the structure">
  Templates are organized intentionally. Keep the section headers and overall structure — just replace the content.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Test with real scenarios">
  After customizing, test with actual questions your customers ask. Use Convo Logs to refine.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Iterate based on logs">
  Review conversation logs after launch. Update your prompt based on what works and what doesn't.
</Accordion>
