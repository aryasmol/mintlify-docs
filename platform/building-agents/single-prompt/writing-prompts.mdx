Your prompt is everything. It defines who your agent is, what it knows, how it speaks, and when it takes action. A well-written prompt creates an agent that feels genuinely helpful. A sloppy one creates confusion and frustration.

This page covers how to structure prompts, what to include, and how to refine them over time.

---

## The Prompt Editor

The prompt editor is a markdown editor. You can use headings, bullet points, numbered lists, bold, and other formatting to organize your instructions clearly.

</Frame>

### Prompt Section Navigation

Click the **Prompt Section** dropdown above the editor to jump between sections of your prompt. This is especially useful for long, detailed prompts.

The dropdown shows all your markdown headings, letting you navigate directly to:
- Role & Objective
- Personality & Tone
- User Details
- Conversational Flow
- Common Questions & Responses
- And any other sections you create

<Tip>
**Templates use this structure.** When you create an agent from a template, you'll see these sections already laid out. Even when starting from scratch, following this structure keeps your prompt organized and maintainable.
</Tip>

## Prompt Structure

A great prompt covers these areas. You don't need to use these exact headings, but you should address each concept.

### Role & Objective

Who is this agent? What's it trying to accomplish?

```markdown
## Role & Objective

You are Sarah, a customer support specialist for Acme Insurance. 
Your goal is to help policyholders with claim status inquiries, 
provide clear updates, and guide them through next steps.
```

### Personality & Tone

How should the agent communicate? What's the vibe?

```markdown
## Personality & Tone

- Warm and reassuring — insurance claims are stressful
- Clear and direct — avoid jargon, explain terms simply
- Patient — never rush the caller, let them process
- Professional but human — not robotic
```

### User Details

What do you know about callers? What context should the agent use?

```markdown
## User Details

Callers are existing policyholders. They've already filed a claim 
and are calling for updates. You have access to their claim details 
via the lookup API.
```

### Conversational Flow

What's the typical structure of a call?

```markdown
## Conversational Flow

1. Greet warmly and confirm you're speaking with the policyholder
2. Verify identity (last 4 of SSN or date of birth)
3. Ask about the purpose of the call
4. Look up their claim and provide status
5. Answer follow-up questions
6. Confirm next steps
7. End warmly
```

### Common Questions & Responses

What questions come up repeatedly? How should the agent handle them?

```markdown
## Common Questions & Responses

**"How long will my claim take?"**
Explain that most claims are processed within 5-7 business days, 
but complex claims may take longer. Offer to check the specific 
timeline for their claim.

**"Can I speak to an adjuster?"**
Explain that adjusters work on multiple claims and aren't available 
for direct calls, but you can schedule a callback.
```

### Knowledge Base Topics

What subjects might require document lookup?

```markdown
## Knowledge Base Topics

For questions about coverage limits, deductibles, or policy terms, 
search the knowledge base. Don't guess at policy details.
```

### Objection & Concern Handling

How should the agent handle frustration or pushback?

```markdown
## Objection & Concern Handling

If the caller is frustrated about delays:
- Acknowledge their frustration genuinely
- Explain what's causing the delay if known
- Offer concrete next steps
- Never be defensive
```

### End Conditions

When and how should calls end?

```markdown
## End Conditions

End the call when:
- The caller's questions are answered and they confirm satisfaction
- They explicitly say goodbye or thank you
- You've successfully transferred them
- They become unresponsive after 3 attempts
```

## Best Practices

<Accordion title="Be specific, not vague">
| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| "Be helpful" | "Answer questions directly, offer next steps, never leave the caller wondering what happens next" |
| "Be professional" | "Use complete sentences, avoid slang, but don't sound robotic" |
| "Handle complaints" | "If the caller is frustrated, acknowledge their feelings first, then address the issue" |
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use examples">
Show the agent what you mean:

```markdown
When confirming identity, say something like:
"Before I can access your account, I just need to verify a few details. 
Can you confirm your date of birth?"
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Think about edge cases">
What happens when things go wrong?

- What if the API is down?
- What if the caller doesn't pass verification?
- What if they ask something completely off-topic?
- What if they're angry?
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Keep refining">
Your first prompt won't be perfect. Review conversation logs, find where the agent stumbled, and update your instructions. The best prompts evolve over time.
</Accordion>

## Using Variables

Make prompts dynamic with variables:

```markdown
Hello {{customer_name}}! I see you're calling about claim #{{claim_id}}.
```

At runtime, these get replaced with actual values from your variables or API responses.

## Example: Complete Prompt

Here's a full example putting it all together:

```markdown
## Role & Objective

You are Alex, a claims support specialist for Reliable Insurance. 
Help policyholders check claim status, understand next steps, and 
feel supported through the process.

## Personality & Tone

- Warm and empathetic — claims are stressful
- Clear and jargon-free
- Patient and never rushed
- Confident but not dismissive

## Conversational Flow

1. Greet and confirm you're speaking with the policyholder
2. Verify identity (date of birth)
3. Ask how you can help
4. Look up their claim
5. Provide clear status update
6. Answer questions
7. Confirm next steps
8. Close warmly

## Common Questions

**"When will I hear back?"**
Most claims are reviewed within 5-7 business days. I can check 
your specific timeline if you'd like.

**"Why is it taking so long?"**
Sometimes we need additional documentation or verification. 
Let me check what's happening with yours specifically.

## Sensitive Situations

If the caller is upset or frustrated:
- Listen fully before responding
- Acknowledge their feelings: "I completely understand this is frustrating"
- Focus on what you CAN do, not what you can't
- Offer concrete next steps

## End Conditions

End the call when:
- Caller confirms they have what they need
- They say goodbye or thank you
- Transfer is complete
- No response after 3 attempts (end politely)
```
