## Common Issues and Solutions

### Low Success Rate

**Symptoms:** 
- Fewer calls achieve desired outcome
- High "unsuccessful" disposition

**Investigate:**
1. Review conversation logs for failed calls
2. Identify where conversations break down
3. Check if callers are asking unexpected questions

**Solutions:**
| Finding | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Agent misunderstands requests | Improve prompt clarity |
| Missing information | Expand Knowledge Base |
| Wrong branch taken (Convo Flow) | Refine conditions |
| Caller frustration | Improve tone/empathy in prompt |

---

### High Transfer Rate

**Symptoms:**
- Many calls end in transfer
- Humans are overloaded

**Investigate:**
1. What triggers transfers?
2. Are they appropriate escalations?
3. Could the agent handle these?

**Solutions:**
| Finding | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Legitimate escalations | Transfer rate is appropriate |
| Agent can't answer questions | Add to Knowledge Base |
| Agent gives up too easily | Adjust prompt instructions |
| Caller requests human | Improve agent experience |

---

### Short Call Duration

**Symptoms:**
- Calls end very quickly
- Low engagement

**Investigate:**
1. Are callers hanging up?
2. Are end conditions triggering too early?
3. Is the greeting off-putting?

**Solutions:**
| Finding | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Poor greeting | Improve opening |
| Immediate hang-up | Check voice/audio quality |
| Misunderstood intent | Improve understanding |
| Too aggressive end conditions | Relax end call triggers |

---

### Very Long Calls

**Symptoms:**
- Calls exceeding expected duration
- Rambling conversations

**Investigate:**
1. Is the agent getting stuck in loops?
2. Is it asking too many questions?
3. Is caller unable to get answers?

**Solutions:**
| Finding | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Loops in Convo Flow | Fix workflow logic |
| Agent too verbose | Shorten responses |
| Caller can't get answer | Improve Knowledge Base |
| No clear path to resolution | Add more direct paths |

---

### Low Satisfaction Scores

**Symptoms:**
- Post-call metrics show unhappy callers

**Investigate:**
1. Read transcripts of low-scoring calls
2. Identify frustration points
3. Note specific complaints

**Solutions:**
| Finding | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Agent sounds robotic | Improve prompt for naturalness |
| Answers are wrong | Fix Knowledge Base |
| Process is frustrating | Simplify workflow |
| Agent doesn't empathize | Add empathy instructions |
