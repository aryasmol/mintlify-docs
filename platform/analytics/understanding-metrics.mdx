The analytics dashboard shows many metrics. This page explains what each one means, how it's calculated, and what insights you can draw.

## Call Volume Metrics

### Total Calls

The number of calls handled in the selected period.

**Includes:**
- Inbound calls answered
- Outbound calls connected

**Use it to:**
- Track overall usage
- Identify busy periods
- Plan capacity

### Inbound vs Outbound

| Type | Source |
|------|--------|
| **Inbound** | Customers calling your numbers |
| **Outbound** | Campaigns calling customers |

**Ratio insight:** 
- High inbound = reactive support
- High outbound = proactive engagement

---

## Duration Metrics

### Average Call Duration

Total call time ÷ Number of calls

**What it indicates:**
- Short calls → Quick resolutions or early hang-ups
- Long calls → Complex issues or engaged conversations
- Very long calls → Possible stuck conversations

**Benchmarks vary by use case:**
- Simple FAQ: 1-2 minutes
- Support: 3-5 minutes
- Sales qualification: 5-10 minutes

### Success Rate

Calls achieving desired outcome ÷ Total calls

Based on **disposition** or **post-call metrics**.
