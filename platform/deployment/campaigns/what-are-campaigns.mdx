description: "Run outbound calling programs at scale with your voice AI agent."
---

Campaigns let your agent make outbound calls — proactively reaching out to customers rather than waiting for them to call. Upload a contact list, configure your agent, and let Atoms handle the calling at scale.

---

## How Campaigns Work

1. **Create a campaign** — Name, agent, and settings
2. **Add contacts** — Upload or create an Audience
3. **Configure** — Timing, retry rules, variables
4. **Launch** — Atoms starts calling
5. **Monitor** — Track progress and results

---

## Use Cases

### Appointment Reminders

```
"Hi {{name}}, this is a reminder about your appointment 
tomorrow at {{time}}. Would you like to confirm or reschedule?"
```

### Payment Reminders

```
"Hello {{name}}, this is a courtesy call about your payment 
of {{amount}} due on {{date}}."
```

### Survey Collection

```
"Hi, we're reaching out to get your feedback on your 
recent experience with {{company}}."
```

### Sales Follow-Up

```
"Hi {{name}}, this is {{agent_name}} following up on your 
interest in {{product}}. Do you have a few minutes?"
```

### Lead Nurturing

```
"Hi {{name}}, I'm calling to share some information about 
{{topic}} that I thought you'd find valuable."
```

## Campaign Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Agent** | The AI that makes calls |
| **Audience** | Contact list to call |
| **Schedule** | When to make calls |
| **Settings** | Retry rules, caller ID, etc. |

---

## Outbound vs Inbound

| Aspect | Inbound | Outbound (Campaigns) |
|--------|---------|----------------------|
| Who initiates | Customer calls you | You call customer |
| Timing | Customer's choice | Your schedule |
| Context | Unknown until call | Known (from contact list) |
| Personalization | Limited | High (use contact data) |

---

## Contact Data

Campaigns use contact lists (Audiences) with:

| Field | Usage |
|-------|-------|
| **Phone number** | Required — who to call |
| **Name** | Personalization `{{name}}` |
| **Custom fields** | Any data for variables |

This data populates variables in your prompts.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Create an agent** for outbound calls
2. **Create an Audience** with your contacts
3. **Create a Campaign** connecting them
4. **Configure** timing and rules
5. **Launch** and monitor
