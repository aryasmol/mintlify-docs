Once you have an Audience, you can use it with multiple campaigns. This page covers how Audiences and Campaigns work together.

---

## Connecting to Campaigns

When creating or editing a campaign:

1. Navigate to the Audience selection step
2. Choose from available Audiences
3. All contacts in that Audience become campaign targets

---

## One Audience, Multiple Campaigns

An Audience can be used in multiple campaigns:

| Audience: "October Leads" | |
|---------------------------|---|
| Campaign 1 | Follow-up calls |
| Campaign 2 | Event invitation |
| Campaign 3 | Survey collection |

Each campaign tracks its own progress independently.

---

## Filtering Audiences

When using an Audience in a campaign, you may be able to filter:

| Filter | Example |
|--------|---------|
| **By field value** | Only contacts where `status = "active"` |
| **By date** | Contacts added after specific date |
| **By previous campaigns** | Exclude contacts from other campaigns |

→ **NEEDS PLATFORM INFO:** Filtering capabilities

---

## Data Flow

Audience data flows to your agent during calls:

```
Audience: "October Leads"
├── Contact: John Smith, +15551234567, amount: $150
│   └── Agent receives: {{name}}, {{phone}}, {{amount}}
│
├── Contact: Jane Doe, +15559876543, amount: $225
│   └── Agent receives: {{name}}, {{phone}}, {{amount}}
│
└── ...
```

Each call gets that contact's specific data.

## Updating Audiences

What happens when you update an Audience that's in use:

| Change | Active Campaign | Future Campaigns |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| Add contacts | Added to queue | Included |
| Remove contacts | Removed from queue (if pending) | Not included |
| Update data | Uses new data | Uses new data |

---

## Best Practices

### Organize by Purpose

Create Audiences for specific purposes:
- "Appointment Reminders - December"
- "Past Customers - Reactivation"
- "Event Attendees - 2024"

### Keep Current

Regularly update Audiences:
- Remove invalid numbers
- Update contact information
- Remove unsubscribed contacts

### Track Usage

Know which campaigns used which Audiences:
- Avoid over-contacting
- Analyze performance by Audience
