## Creating an Audience

→ **NEEDS PLATFORM INFO:** Audience creation interface

### Step 1: Start Creation

Click **"Create Audience"** button.

### Step 2: Basic Details

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Name** | Audience identifier | "Q4 Leads" |
| **Description** | Optional notes | "Leads from October event" |

### Step 3: Add Contacts

Two methods:

**Upload File:**
- CSV or Excel
- Must include phone column
- Can include any custom fields

**Manual Entry:**
- Add contacts one by one
- Good for small lists

### Step 4: Map Fields

After upload, map columns to fields:

| Your Column | Maps To |
|-------------|---------|
| "Phone Number" | phone (required) |
| "First Name" | name |
| "Account ID" | account_id |
| "Amount" | amount |

Custom fields become variables: `{{account_id}}`, `{{amount}}`

### Step 5: Save

Click **Save** to create the Audience.

- Name
- Email
- Appointment date
- Account number
- Custom fields

### Example CSV

```csv

```

## Using Variables from Audiences

Audience data populates agent variables:

**In your agent prompt:**
```
Hi {{name}}, this is a reminder about your appointment on {{appointment_date}}.
Your balance is ${{amount}}.
```

**During the call:**
```
Hi John Smith, this is a reminder about your appointment on July 20th.
Your balance is $150.00.
```

## Best Practices

### Data Quality

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Verify phone numbers | Use invalid numbers |
| Keep data current | Use stale lists |
| Standardize formatting | Mix formats |

### Phone Number Formatting

Include country code when possible:
- Good: +15551234567
- Okay: 5551234567
- Bad: 555-1234 (incomplete)

### Consent

Ensure you have appropriate consent to contact everyone in your Audience.
