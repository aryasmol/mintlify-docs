After building and testing your agent, it's time to deploy. Atoms offers multiple deployment options depending on how you want users to interact with your agent.

---

## Deployment Options

| Method | Description | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Phone Numbers** | Assign a phone number for inbound calls | Customer support, hotlines |
| **Widget** | Embed on your website | Web visitors, integrated support |
| **Campaigns** | Outbound calling at scale | Reminders, sales outreach |

## Phone Numbers

Get a phone number and assign it to your agent. When customers call that number, your agent answers.
