Audiences are your contact lists—the people your agents will call during campaigns. Each audience contains phone numbers and any additional information you want your agent to reference during conversations.

## Creating an Audience

Click **Create Audience** (green button, top right) to start a three-step process.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload CSV">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/platform/building-agents/images/upload-csv.png" alt="Upload CSV step" />
    </Frame>

    <Warning>
      All recipients must have explicit consent to be contacted. Atoms prohibits purchased, rented, or third-party phone lists.
    </Warning>

    Upload a CSV with your contacts (max 10 MB). Your CSV needs a phone number column—everything else is flexible.

    ```csv
    phoneNumber,Name,Email,CustomerID
    919999900000,John,john@example.com,CUST001
    919999900001,Alice,alice@example.com,CUST002
    ```

    Phone numbers should be in international format (`+919999900000` or `919999900000`).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Map Phone Number">
    Tell us which column contains the phone numbers.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/platform/building-agents/images/map-phone.png" alt="Map phone number column" />
    </Frame>

    You'll see a preview of your CSV data. Select the column that contains valid phone numbers from the dropdown.

    <Tip>
      Only the phone number column needs to be mapped—everything else is up to you. Include any additional information you want available during calls (names, order IDs, account numbers, etc.).
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Contacts">
    Give your audience a name and optional description.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/platform/building-agents/images/add-contacts.png" alt="Name your audience" />
    </Frame>

    | Field | Required | Example |
    |-------|----------|---------|
    | Audience Name | Yes | VIP Customers List |
    | Description | No | High-value customers for premium promotions |

    Click **Create Audience** to finish.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Adding Members to Existing Audiences

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Add Manually">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/platform/building-agents/images/add-manually.png" alt="Add member manually" />
    </Frame>

    Fill in the contact details one at a time:
    - **phoneNumber** (required) — in international format
    - Plus any other fields defined in your audience

    Click **Add Member** to save.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Import CSV">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/platform/building-agents/images/import-csv.png" alt="Import CSV to audience" />
    </Frame>

    Upload another CSV file to add contacts in bulk.
    
    - CSV headers should match your audience fields
    - Maximum file size: 10 MB
    - Click to upload or drag and drop
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Using Audience Data in Calls

The columns you upload become available as variables during campaigns. If your CSV has a "Name" column, your agent can greet callers by name.

See [Variables](/platform/building-agents/configuring/variables) for more.
