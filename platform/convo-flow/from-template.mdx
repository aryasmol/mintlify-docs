## Getting There

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Create Agent">
    From your dashboard, click the green **Create Agent** button in the top right.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose Start with Template">
    Select the second option in the modal.
    
    <Frame caption="Creation method selection">
      <img src="/platform/building-agents/images/create-agent-modal.png" alt="Create agent modal" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Browse and Select">
    Use **Filter By** to narrow by industry, direction (inbound/outbound), or agent type. Click any template to select it, then hit **Create**.
    
    <Frame caption="Template gallery">
      <img src="/platform/building-agents/images/template-gallery.png" alt="Template selection screen" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

The editor opens with a complete workflow — nodes, branches, and settings ready to customize.

## What Templates Include

Each template comes with a complete starting point:

| Component | What You Get |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Complete Workflow** | Nodes and branches for the entire conversation flow |
| **Node Prompts** | Pre-written prompts for each step |
| **Branch Conditions** | Logic already configured for common responses |
| **Voice Selection** | A voice that fits the use case |

Templates follow proven conversation patterns for their use case. The structure is designed — you just need to customize the details.

## Customizing Your Template

Templates are starting points. Always replace the placeholders with your specifics:

- **Company name and details** — Replace placeholder names with your actual business
- **Policies and rules** — Update return windows, hours, pricing, etc.
- **Node prompts** — Adjust the tone to match your brand
- **Branch conditions** — Add or modify paths for your specific needs

<Tip>
**Keep the structure.** Templates are organized intentionally. Replace the content, but keep the overall flow — it's designed for that use case.
