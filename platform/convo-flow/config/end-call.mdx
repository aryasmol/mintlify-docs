In Conversational Flow, calls end when the conversation reaches an **End Call node**. This node terminates the call gracefully with a closing message.

---

## How End Calls Work

Unlike Single Prompt agents where end conditions trigger automatically, Conversational Flow agents end calls explicitly when the flow reaches an End Call node.

```
[Conversation Flow]
    ↓
[Final Question]
├── "User confirms" → [End Call: Resolved]
├── "User has more questions" → [Loop back]
└── "User wants transfer" → [Transfer Call]
```

---

## End Call Node Configuration

Click an End Call node to configure it.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | Identifier shown on canvas (e.g., "End - Resolved") |
| **Closing Message** | What the agent says before hanging up |

### Example Closings

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Issue Resolved">
    ```
    Great! I'm glad I could help. Is there anything else 
    before I let you go? ... Perfect! Thank you for calling 
    Acme Support. Have a wonderful day!
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="After Transfer">
    ```
    I'm connecting you now. Thanks for calling Acme, and 
    have a great day!
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Not Qualified">
    ```
    Thanks so much for your interest. I'll have someone 
    send over some resources that might be helpful. Take care!
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="No Response">
    ```
    It seems like you might have stepped away. Feel free to 
    call back anytime if you need assistance. Goodbye!
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Multiple End Points

Your flow will likely have multiple End Call nodes for different outcomes:

| End Call Node | Use Case |
|---------------|----------|
| `End - Resolved` | Issue successfully handled |
| `End - Goodbye` | Customer said goodbye |
| `End - Transfer Complete` | After successful transfer |
| `End - No Response` | Caller became unresponsive |
| `End - Out of Scope` | Couldn't help, directed elsewhere |
| `End - Callback Scheduled` | Follow-up arranged |

<Warning>
**Every path must end.** Make sure all branches in your flow eventually reach an End Call or Transfer Call node. Use the validation feature to find orphaned paths.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<Accordion title="Confirm before ending">
  Don't assume the caller is done. Ask for confirmation:
  
  ```
  Is there anything else I can help you with today?
  ```
  
  Create branches:
  - "User confirms they're done" → End Call
  - "User has more questions" → Loop back
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Match closing to outcome">
  Different endings deserve different messages:
  
  | Outcome | Closing Tone |
  |---------|--------------|
  | Resolved | Warm, celebratory |
  | Not qualified | Helpful, redirecting |
  | No response | Polite, inviting return |
  | After transfer | Brief, professional |
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Include summary when helpful">
  For complex interactions, summarize before closing:
  
  ```
  Just to recap — I've scheduled your appointment for Tuesday 
  at 3pm, and sent a confirmation to {{customer_email}}. 
  Is there anything else before we wrap up?
  ```
</Accordion>
