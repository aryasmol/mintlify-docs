In Conversational Flow, transfers happen when the conversation reaches a **Transfer Call node**. This hands the call to a human agent via cold or warm transfer.

---

## How Transfers Work

Transfer Call nodes route callers to human agents when the AI can't (or shouldn't) handle the situation.

```
[Conversation Flow]
    ↓
[Handle Request]
├── AI can resolve → Continue flow
├── Needs human → [Transfer Call: Support]
└── VIP customer → [Transfer Call: Premium Line]
```

## Transfer Call Node Configuration

Click a Transfer Call node to configure it.

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Name** | Yes | Identifier (e.g., `transfer_to_sales`) |
| **Description** | Yes | Internal note about when this transfer triggers |
| **Phone Number** | Yes | Transfer destination with country code |
| **Transfer Type** | Yes | Cold or Warm |

---

## Transfer Types

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Cold Transfer">
    **Immediate handoff.** The caller is connected directly to the destination without any briefing to the receiving agent.
    
    | Pros | Cons |
    |------|------|
    | Fast | No context for receiving agent |
    | Simple | Caller may repeat themselves |
    
    **Best for:**
    - Simple escalations
    - When context isn't needed
    - Time-sensitive transfers
    - High call volume scenarios
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Warm Transfer">
    **AI briefs the agent first.** The receiving agent gets context before the caller joins.
    
    | Pros | Cons |
    |------|------|
    | Human has context | Slightly longer |
    | Better experience | More configuration |
    
    **Best for:**
    - Complex issues needing context
    - VIP callers
    - When continuity matters
    
    ### Warm Transfer Options
    
    | Setting | Description |
    |---------|-------------|
    | **On-hold Music** | What the caller hears while waiting for connection |
    | **Transfer if Human** | Skip transfer if voicemail detected (coming soon) |
    | **Whisper Message** | Private message only the agent hears before connecting |
    | **Handoff Message** | What the AI says to brief the receiving agent |
    | **Three-way Message** | Message both parties hear when connected |
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Warm Transfer Messages

### Whisper Message

Only the agent hears this — give them everything they need:

```
Incoming transfer: Customer {{customer_name}} calling about 
a billing dispute. They've been charged twice for order #{{order_id}}. 
Identity already verified.
```

### Handoff Message

What the AI says to brief the agent (can include variables):

```
Hi, I'm transferring a customer who needs help with a technical 
issue. They've tried restarting their device without success.
```

### Three-way Message

Both parties hear this — use it for smooth introductions:

```
I've connected you with Sarah from our billing team. 
Sarah, {{customer_name}} is calling about a duplicate charge.
```

## Multiple Transfer Destinations

Create multiple Transfer Call nodes for different scenarios:

| Transfer Node | Destination | When |
|---------------|-------------|------|
| `Transfer - Sales` | Sales team | Purchase interest, demo requests |
| `Transfer - Support` | Support team | Technical issues |
| `Transfer - Billing` | Billing team | Payment questions |
| `Transfer - Manager` | Manager line | Escalations, complaints |

## Best Practices

<Accordion title="Set expectations before transferring">
  Tell the caller what's happening:
  
  ```
  I'm going to connect you with one of our billing specialists 
  who can help resolve this. It may take just a moment to connect. 
  Is that okay?
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use warm transfers for complex issues">
  When context matters, always use warm transfer:
  
  - The caller has explained a complex problem
  - You've already verified their identity
  - The issue requires sensitive handling
  - The caller is frustrated
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Include relevant context in whisper messages">
  Make whisper messages actionable:
  
  | Good | Bad |
  |------|-----|
  | "Billing dispute: double-charged $150, order #12345" | "Billing issue" |
  | "Technical: Can't log in, tried password reset 3x" | "Login problem" |
  | "VIP customer, account value $50k/year" | "Important customer" |
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Handle transfer failures">
  What happens if the transfer line is busy or doesn't answer?
  
  Consider adding a branch that handles transfer failure:
  - Offer to schedule a callback
  - Provide an alternative contact method
  - Return to AI handling with apology
</Accordion>
