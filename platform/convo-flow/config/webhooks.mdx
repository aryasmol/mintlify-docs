Webhooks push real-time data to your systems when call events happen — starts, ends, analytics ready. Use them to update CRMs, create tickets, trigger workflows, or feed analytics pipelines.

**Location:** Settings tab → Webhooks

## Adding to Your Agent

Once a webhook endpoint exists, connect it to your agent here.

<Frame caption="Webhook tab in agent settings">

</Frame>

Select your webhook from the dropdown. The agent will now send events to that endpoint.
