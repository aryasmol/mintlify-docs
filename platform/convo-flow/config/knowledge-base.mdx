A Knowledge Base is a repository of information your agent can search during conversations. Instead of cramming everything into the prompt, upload documents — product specs, policies, FAQs — and let the agent retrieve what it needs.

**Location:** Settings tab → Model → Knowledge Base dropdown

</Frame>

<Note>
In Conversational Flow agents, Knowledge Base is configured in the **Model tab** alongside the Global Prompt, not in a separate configuration panel.
</Note>

## Setup

1. Go to **Settings** tab
2. Open **Model** section
3. Find the **Knowledge Base** dropdown
4. Select a KB from the list (or "No Knowledge Base")

<Note>
You need to create a Knowledge Base first before you can attach it here. See [Creating Knowledge Bases](/platform/features/knowledge-base/creating).

## Local vs Global

| Type | Scope | Best For |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Local** | This agent only | Agent-specific information |
| **Global** | Shared across agents | Company-wide policies, general FAQs |

---

## How It Works

1. **Caller asks a question** → "What's your return policy?"
2. **Agent searches KB** → Finds relevant documents automatically
3. **Agent responds** → Uses retrieved information in the answer

The agent decides when to search based on the question. You don't need to configure triggers — it happens automatically when relevant.

## KB + Global Prompt

In Conversational Flow, both the Knowledge Base and Global Prompt are in the Model tab. They work together:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Global Prompt** | Personality, behavior guidelines, style instructions |
| **Knowledge Base** | Factual reference material, policies, product info |

**Example Global Prompt instruction:**

```markdown
When answering questions about products, pricing, or policies, 
always check the knowledge base first. Don't guess at specific 
details like prices or return windows.
```

## Best Practices

<Accordion title="Use KB for reference, prompt for behavior">
  | Put in KB | Put in Prompt |
  |-----------|---------------|
  | Product details | Personality and tone |
  | Policies | Conversation patterns |
  | FAQ answers | End conditions |
  | Pricing info | Behavioral guidelines |
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Keep documents focused">
  Smaller, topic-specific documents retrieve better than massive catch-all files.
  
  | Better | Worse |
  |--------|-------|
  | `returns-policy.pdf` | `everything.pdf` |
  | `pricing-2024.txt` | `company-info.docx` (500 pages) |
  | `product-specs-widget.md` | `all-products.pdf` |
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Test retrieval">
  Ask your agent questions that should hit the KB. Verify it finds the right information:
  
  1. Test with expected questions ("What's the return window?")
  2. Test with variations ("Can I return something after 30 days?")
  3. Check Conversation Logs to see what was retrieved
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Instruct when to use KB in Global Prompt">
  Tell your agent when to consult the knowledge base:
  
  ```
  For any question about specific policies, pricing, or product 
  specifications, search the knowledge base. Never make up numbers 
  or policy details.
  ```
</Accordion>
