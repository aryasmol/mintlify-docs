General Settings control how long your agent waits for a response before prompting the caller — and when to give up.

## LLM Idle Timeout Settings

Configure how long the agent waits for user response before sending an inactivity message. After 3 attempts with no response, the conversation automatically ends.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Chat Timeout** | 60 sec | For text chat conversations |
| **Webcall Timeout** | 20 sec | For browser-based voice calls |
| **Telephony Timeout** | 20 sec | For phone calls |

Each timeout triggers an inactivity prompt. If the user still doesn't respond after 3 prompts, the agent ends the conversation gracefully.
