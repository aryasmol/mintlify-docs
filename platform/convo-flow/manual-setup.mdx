Starting from scratch gives you complete control. You'll land in an empty workflow builder ready for your design.

## Getting There

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Create Agent">
    From your dashboard, click the green **Create Agent** button in the top right.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose Start from Scratch">
    Select the first option in the modal.
    
    <Frame caption="Creation method selection">
      <img src="/platform/building-agents/images/create-agent-modal.png" alt="Create agent modal" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Conversational Flow">
    Choose **Conversational Flow** as your agent type.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The editor opens with an empty canvas — ready for you to build your workflow.

## What's Next

You're now in the editor. Here's where to go from here:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Build Your Workflow" icon="diagram-project" href="/platform/convo-flow/workflow-builder">
    Learn the canvas and start adding nodes
  </Card>
  <Card title="Understand Nodes" icon="shapes" href="/platform/convo-flow/node-types">
    Every node type and how to use them
  </Card>
  <Card title="Set Up Branches" icon="code-branch" href="/platform/convo-flow/conditions">
    Create paths based on caller responses
  </Card>
  <Card title="Configure Settings" icon="sliders" href="/platform/convo-flow/config/voice-settings">
    Voice, model, and agent settings
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
**First time?** Start by dragging a Default node onto the canvas, writing a greeting, and hitting **Test Agent** (top right). You can build out the full flow as you go.
