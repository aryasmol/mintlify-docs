The General Tab contains timeout settings that control what happens when callers become unresponsive.

## Location

**Left Sidebar → Agent Settings → General tab**

## LLM Idle Timeout Settings

> Configure how long agent waits for user response before sending inactivity message. After 3 attempts, conversation automatically ends.

| Setting | Input | Default | Description |
|---------|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Chat Timeout** | Seconds | 60 | Timeout for chat/text conversations |
| **Webcall Timeout** | Seconds | 20 | Timeout for browser voice calls |
| **Telephony Timeout** | Seconds | (configurable) | Timeout for phone calls |

---

## How Timeout Works

1. **User stops responding** — Silence detected
2. **Timeout triggers** — After configured seconds
3. **Agent sends inactivity message** — "Are you still there?"
4. **Repeats up to 3 times** — Giving user chances to respond
5. **Call ends automatically** — After 3 failed attempts

## Setting Recommendations

| Channel | Recommended Timeout | Reason |
|---------|---------------------|--------|
| Chat | 60s | Users may be multitasking |
| Web Call | 20s | Real-time, expect engagement |
| Telephony | 15-30s | Phone calls expect quick responses |

---

## Inactivity Messages

When timeout triggers, the agent sends a re-engagement message. Configure what the agent says in your prompt:

```
If the user hasn't responded for a while, say something like:
"I'm still here if you need anything. Is there something I can help with?"
```

## Use Cases

### Short Timeouts (10-20s)

- Sales calls where engagement matters
- Time-sensitive conversations
- Active support calls

### Longer Timeouts (30-60s)

- Complex issues where user might be looking something up
- Multi-tasking expected
- User might be finding information
