## Location

**Left Sidebar → Agent Settings → Model tab**

---

## AI Model

| Setting | Control | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **LLM Model** | Dropdown | GPT-4o |
| **Language** | Dropdown | English |

### Model Selection

Choose the LLM that powers your agent's understanding and responses. This is the same as the Prompt Section model dropdown.

### Language

Set the primary language. This should match your voice selection's language capability.

---

## Speech Formatting

| Setting | Toggle | Default |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **Speech Formatting** | ON/OFF | ON |

When enabled, the system formats responses for natural speech:
- Expands abbreviations
- Handles numbers naturally
- Formats dates and times for speaking

**Example:**
- Written: "Your appt is on 1/15/24 at 3:00pm"
- Spoken: "Your appointment is on January fifteenth, twenty twenty-four at three p m"

## Language Switching

| Setting | Toggle | Default |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **Language Switching** | ON/OFF | ON |

When enabled, the agent can detect when a caller switches languages and respond in kind.

### Advanced Language Switching Settings

When language switching is enabled, additional controls appear:

> Controls how accurately agent detects language switches. Higher thresholds reduce false switches; lower thresholds allow quicker changes.

| Setting | Range | Default | Description |
|---------|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Minimum Words for Detection** | 1-10 | 2 | Words needed before switching |
| **Strong Signal Threshold** | Low-High | 0.7 | Confidence for immediate switch |
| **Weak Signal Threshold** | Low-High | 0.3 | Confidence for tentative detection |
| **Consecutive Weak Signals** | 1-8 | 2 | Weak signals needed to switch |

### Understanding the Settings

**Minimum Words for Detection**
How many words in the new language before considering a switch. Higher = more conservative.

**Strong Signal Threshold**
If confidence is above this level, switch immediately. Higher = requires more certainty.

**Weak Signal Threshold**
Confidence level that counts as "maybe" a language switch. Below this is ignored.

**Consecutive Weak Signals**
How many weak signals in a row before switching. Higher = more conservative.
