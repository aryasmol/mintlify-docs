The Phone Number Tab lets you connect your agent to a phone number. Once assigned, inbound calls to that number are handled by this agent.

## Location

**Left Sidebar → Agent Settings → Phone Number tab**

---

## Assigning a Number

1. Navigate to Agent Settings → Phone Number tab
2. Click the phone number dropdown
3. Select from available numbers
4. Save changes

## Available Numbers

The dropdown shows phone numbers you've acquired through Atoms:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Available** | Not assigned to any agent |
| **Assigned** | Currently used by another agent (shown with agent name) |

You can only assign numbers that aren't already in use.

## Getting Phone Numbers

Before you can assign a number, you need to acquire one.

→ See: [Getting a Number](/platform/deployment/phone-numbers/getting-number)

---

## One Number Per Agent

Each phone number can only be assigned to one agent at a time.

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Number is free | Can assign to this agent |
| Number assigned elsewhere | Must unassign first, or choose different number |

To reassign a number:
1. Go to the agent currently using it
2. Unassign or assign a different number
3. Return to your agent and assign

## Inbound vs Outbound

**Inbound Calls:**
When someone calls your assigned number, this agent handles the conversation.

**Outbound Calls:**
For outbound, you use Campaigns which specify which agent makes calls. The Phone Number Tab is primarily for inbound.

→ See: [Campaigns](/platform/deployment/campaigns/what-are-campaigns)
