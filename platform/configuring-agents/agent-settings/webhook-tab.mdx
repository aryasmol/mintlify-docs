The Webhook Tab lets you configure automatic notifications when call events occur. When something happens (call starts, call ends, analytics ready), Atoms sends data to your specified URL.

## How Webhooks Work

1. An event occurs (e.g., call ends)
2. Atoms sends an HTTP POST to your endpoint
3. Your system receives call data
4. You process it as needed (log, update CRM, trigger workflows)

---

## Configuration

### Webhook Endpoint

| Field | Control | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Webhook Endpoint** | Dropdown | Select from existing webhooks |

You must create webhook endpoints first before they appear here.

→ See: [Creating Endpoints](/platform/features/webhooks/creating-endpoints)

### Events to Subscribe

| Event | When It Fires | Data Included |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| **Start** | When call begins, before conversation | Caller info, timestamp |
| **End** | When call ends | Transcript, duration, outcome |
| **Analytics Completed** | When post-call analytics finish | Metrics, analysis |

Check the events you want to receive.
