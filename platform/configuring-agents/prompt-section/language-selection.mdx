## Best Practices

### Choose Primary Language First

Set the language most callers will use as the primary language.

### Match Voice to Language

Some voices sound more natural in certain languages. Preview the voice speaking your target language.

### Test with Native Speakers

Speech recognition and synthesis quality varies by language. Test with native speakers when possible.
