## Choosing the Right Voice

### Match Your Brand

| Brand Personality | Voice Characteristics |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Professional/Corporate | Clear, neutral, confident |
| Friendly/Casual | Warm, approachable, upbeat |
| Authoritative | Deep, measured, assured |
| Youthful | Energetic, modern |

### Consider Your Audience

- Who are your callers?
- What do they expect?
- What builds trust with them?

### Multi-Language Needs

If your agent handles multiple languages, choose a voice that supports all needed languages (like Rachel with 18+ languages).

## Best Practices

- **Preview before selecting** — Hearing is believing
- **Test in real calls** — Browser preview differs from phone audio
- **Match to use case** — Support vs. sales may need different voices
- **Consider consistency** — Use the same voice across similar agents
