### 1. During Transfer Call

| Setting | Control | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **On-hold Music** | Dropdown | Music caller hears while transferring |

Options: Ringtone, Classical, Jazz, None, etc.

### 2. During Agent Connection

| **Transfer only if human answers** | Checkbox | Coming Soon — Skip voicemails |
| **Whisper Message** | Toggle | Message ONLY the receiving agent hears |
| **Handoff Message** | Text/Prompt | Content of the whisper message |

**Whisper Message:** This is spoken to the receiving agent before connecting. The caller doesn't hear it.

## Writing Descriptions

The description tells the AI when to trigger the transfer.

### Good Examples

```
Transfer to the sales team when the caller is interested in 
purchasing and ready to speak with a sales representative.
```

```
Transfer to a supervisor when the caller requests to speak with 
a manager or when the issue requires authorization beyond my scope.
```

### Specify Conditions Clearly

- What keywords trigger it?
- What situations require it?
- What should happen first?

---

## Multiple Transfer Destinations

Create separate transfers for different scenarios:

| Transfer Name | Destination | Trigger |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| `transfer_billing` | Billing team | Billing questions |
| `transfer_technical` | Tech support | Technical issues |
| `transfer_sales` | Sales team | Purchase interest |
| `transfer_supervisor` | Management | Escalation requests |

---

## Best Practices

### Use Warm Transfer for Complex Issues

The brief context saves time and improves customer experience.

### Write Helpful Whisper Messages

Include:
- Customer name (if known)
- Issue summary
- Account info (if relevant)
- What you've already tried

### Test Transfer Flows

Verify:
- Number connects correctly
- Whisper plays only to agent
- Hold music works
- Three-way message is clear
