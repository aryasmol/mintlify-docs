Knowledge Base configuration lets you connect a repository of information that your agent can reference during conversations. This is essential for agents that need to answer detailed questions accurately.

---

## Location

**Configuration Panel (right sidebar) → Knowledge Base**

---

## Enabling Knowledge Base

1. Find "Knowledge Base" in the Configuration Panel
2. Toggle it **ON**
3. Select a KB from the dropdown

## Selecting a Knowledge Base

The dropdown shows available knowledge bases:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **None** | Agent relies only on prompt |
| **[Your KB names]** | Available knowledge bases |

Select the KB you want this agent to use.

## Local vs Global KB

| Type | Scope | Best For |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Local KB** | Only this agent | Agent-specific information |
| **Global KB** | Shared across agents | Company-wide FAQs, policies |

→ See: [Knowledge Base Features](/platform/features/knowledge-base/what-is-kb) for creating and managing KBs

## How It Works

When a caller asks a question:

1. Agent checks if the answer might be in the KB
2. Searches the KB for relevant content
3. Uses that content to form an accurate response
4. Cites information from your documents

This helps agents answer questions they couldn't know from the prompt alone.

## When to Use

| Use Case | KB Value |
|----------|----------|
| Product FAQ | High — answer product questions accurately |
| Pricing information | High — give correct prices |
| Policy details | High — cite official policies |
| General support | Medium — supplements prompt |
| Simple tasks | Low — may not need external info |

---

## Requirements

Before you can attach a KB:

1. **Create the Knowledge Base** — In the Build section
2. **Upload content** — Documents, URLs, text
3. **Wait for processing** — Content needs indexing

## Best Practices

### Keep KB Content Current

Outdated information leads to wrong answers. Update your KB when information changes.

### Structure Content Well

Well-organized documents are easier to search. Use clear headings and sections.

### Test Retrieval

Ask questions that should use KB content. Verify the agent finds and uses the right information.

### Don't Overload

Focus on information the agent actually needs. Too much content can reduce retrieval accuracy.
