Variables let you insert dynamic values into your prompts. Instead of hardcoding information, you use placeholders that get replaced with real data at runtime.

## Location

**Configuration Panel (right sidebar) → Variables Management**

---

## Variable Syntax

Use double curly braces:

```
{{variable_name}}
```

### Example in Prompt

```
Hello {{customer_name}}, I see you're calling about order {{order_id}}.
Your order status is currently {{order_status}}.
```

At runtime, this becomes:
```
Hello John, I see you're calling about order #12345.
Your order status is currently shipped.
```

---

## Variable Types

The Variable Management Panel has three tabs:

| Tab | Source | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| **User Defined** | You create them | Custom variables for your needs |
| **System** | Platform provides | Built-in variables from Atoms |
| **API** | API responses | Variables from API call results |

---

## User Defined Variables

Variables you create and manage.

### Empty State

```
{ }
No user variables found
Add variables to your prompt using
{{variable_name}} syntax.
```

### Adding Variables

Variables appear when you:
1. Type `{{variable_name}}` in your prompt
2. The system detects and lists it
3. You can set default values if needed

### Common User Variables

| Variable | Example Use |
|----------|-------------|
| `{{company_name}}` | Your company name |
| `{{product_name}}` | Product being discussed |
| `{{promo_code}}` | Current promotion code |
| `{{team_name}}` | Department name |

---

## System Variables

Built-in variables provided by Atoms.

| Variable | Contains |
|----------|----------|
| `{{caller_phone}}` | Caller's phone number |
| `{{call_time}}` | When the call started |
| `{{call_duration}}` | How long the call has lasted |
| `{{current_date}}` | Today's date |
| `{{current_time}}` | Current time |

→ See: [Variables Reference](/platform/features/variables-reference) for complete list

---

## API Variables

Variables populated from API call responses.

When an API Call returns data, you can map response fields to variables:

```json
// API Response
{
  "customer_name": "Jane Smith",
  "account_status": "active",
  "balance": "$1,234.56"
}

// Mapped Variables
{{api.customer_name}} → "Jane Smith"
{{api.account_status}} → "active"
{{api.balance}} → "$1,234.56"
```

Use these in subsequent prompts or nodes.

---

## Using Variables Effectively

### Personalization

```
Hi {{customer_name}}! Thanks for being a {{membership_level}} member.
```

### Dynamic Information

```
Your order {{order_id}} is scheduled for delivery on {{delivery_date}}.
```

### Conditional Context

Variables can inform behavior:
```
If {{account_type}} is "premium", offer priority support.
```

---

## Best Practices

### Use Descriptive Names

- Good: `{{customer_first_name}}`
- Bad: `{{n1}}`

### Handle Missing Variables

What if a variable isn't set? Have graceful fallbacks in your prompt:
```
Hi {{customer_name|there}}! (Uses "there" if name unknown)
```

### Test Variable Substitution

Verify variables are replaced correctly in test conversations.

### Keep Track

Document your variables so team members understand what each one does.
