End Call configuration defines when the AI should end conversations. Without proper end call setup, agents may hang on awkwardly or end calls too abruptly.

### Modal Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Example |
|-------|------|----------|---------|
| **Name** | Text input | Yes | `end_call` |
| **Description** | Text area | Yes | `Terminate the current call` |

---

## Writing Descriptions

The **Description** tells the AI when to trigger this function. Be clear and specific.

### Good Examples

```
End the call when the customer confirms their issue is resolved 
and has no more questions.
```

```
Terminate the conversation when the user says goodbye, thanks you, 
or indicates they're done.
```

```
End the call after successfully transferring to a human agent.
```

### Bad Examples

```
End call
```
(Too vague — AI doesn't know when)

```
When done
```
(What counts as "done"?)

## Common End Call Triggers

| Trigger | Description Example |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Issue Resolved** | "Customer confirms their issue is resolved" |
| **User Says Goodbye** | "User says goodbye, thanks, or indicates they're done" |
| **Task Complete** | "Appointment is successfully booked and confirmed" |
| **Transfer Success** | "Call has been transferred to human agent" |
| **No Response** | "User is unresponsive after 3 attempts to re-engage" |
| **Cannot Help** | "Issue is outside scope and no transfer is available" |

---

## Multiple End Call Functions

Create separate functions for different scenarios:

| Function Name | Trigger |
|---------------|---------|
| `successful_resolution` | Issue resolved, customer satisfied |
| `customer_goodbye` | Customer ends conversation |
| `transfer_complete` | Handoff to human successful |
| `no_response_timeout` | Caller unresponsive |

This provides better analytics — you can see how calls ended.

---

## Best Practices

### Be Specific

The AI uses your description to decide when to end. Specific descriptions = accurate behavior.

### Cover All Scenarios

Think about every way a call might end:
- Happy path (resolved)
- Customer-initiated (goodbye)
- Handoff (transfer)
- Edge cases (unresponsive, can't help)

### Test Each Trigger

In testing, verify each end condition triggers properly. Check conversation logs.
