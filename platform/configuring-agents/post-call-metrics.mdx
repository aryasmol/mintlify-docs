## What Are Post-Call Metrics?

After each call, Atoms can analyze the conversation and extract specific information:

- Did the issue get resolved?
- What product was discussed?
- How satisfied was the customer?
- Does this need follow-up?

This data helps you understand performance and improve over time.

## Using Templates

Click **Templates** in the left panel to see pre-built metric sets:

- Common support metrics
- Sales qualification metrics
- Satisfaction metrics

Templates pre-fill identifier, type, and prompt. Customize as needed.

---

## Viewing Results

After calls complete, metrics appear in:

- **Conversation Logs** — Individual call details
- **Analytics Dashboard** — Aggregate views
- **Webhook Payloads** — Sent to your systems (Analytics Completed event)

---

## Best Practices

### Write Clear Prompts

The AI uses your prompt to analyze. Be specific:

**Vague:** "Was the customer happy?"

**Better:** "Based on the customer's language, tone, and explicit statements, rate their satisfaction from 1-5."

### Use Consistent Identifiers

Stick to a naming convention across agents for easier analysis.

### Start Simple

Begin with 3-5 key metrics. You can always add more later.

### Test with Real Calls

Make test calls and verify metrics are extracted correctly.
