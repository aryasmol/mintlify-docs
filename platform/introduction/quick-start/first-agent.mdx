## Step 1: Start Creating

From your dashboard, click the green **"Create Agent"** button in the top right corner.

---

## Step 2: Choose Your Method

A modal appears with three options:

| Option | Icon | When to Use |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **Start from scratch** | + | Build manually from blank |
| **Start with Template** | Grid | Use pre-built templates |
| **Create with AI** | Sparkle | AI-assisted creation |

For this quickstart, select **"Start from scratch"**.

---

## Step 3: Select Agent Type

Choose **"Single Prompt"** — it's the simplest way to get started.

---

## Step 4: Write Your Prompt

You're now in the agent editor. In the main prompt area, write:

```
You are a friendly assistant for [Your Company Name]. 

Help users with basic questions about our products and services. 
Be polite, concise, and helpful.
If you don't know something, say so honestly.
Keep responses under 30 words when possible.
```

Replace `[Your Company Name]` with your actual company name.

## Step 5: Select a Voice

In the top bar, click the **Voice** dropdown and select a voice. We recommend **Tiffany** for a friendly, professional sound.

Click the play button to preview before selecting.

---

## Step 6: Test Your Agent

Click **"Test Agent"** in the top right corner.

A modal appears with three test options:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Telephony Call** | Get a real phone call |
| **Web Call** | Talk through your browser |
| **Chat** | Text-only testing |

Select **"Web Call"** for the quickest test.

---

## Step 7: Have a Conversation

Your browser will connect to your agent. Try saying:

- "Hi, can you tell me about your company?"
- "What services do you offer?"
- "Thanks for your help!"

Listen to how the agent responds. This is your first voice AI agent!
