Voice AI agents seem like magic — you speak, they understand, they respond naturally. But under the hood, there's a sophisticated pipeline making it all happen in real-time. Understanding this helps you build better agents.

## The Voice AI Pipeline

Every voice conversation flows through three core stages:

```
🎤 Speech-to-Text → 🧠 LLM Processing → 🔊 Text-to-Speech
```

### 1. Speech-to-Text (STT)

When a caller speaks, their audio is captured and converted to text. This happens in real-time, word by word, so the system can start processing before the caller finishes speaking.

**Key factors:**
- Accuracy of transcription
- Handling accents and background noise
- Speed of processing

### 2. LLM Processing

The transcribed text goes to a language model that:
- Understands the intent behind words
- Considers conversation context
- Generates an appropriate response
- Follows your configured prompts and rules

This is where your agent's "brain" lives — the prompts you write, the knowledge base you attach, and the logic you define.

### 3. Text-to-Speech (TTS)

The model's text response is converted back to natural-sounding speech. Modern TTS systems produce remarkably human-like voices with appropriate intonation, pacing, and emotion.

## Why Latency Matters

In voice conversations, **latency** is everything. Humans expect responses within 200-400ms — any longer feels unnatural.

Traditional large language models struggle here:
- Processing takes 1-2+ seconds
- Users experience awkward pauses
- Conversations feel robotic

**Atoms solves this with Small Language Models:**
- 100ms streaming responses
- Start speaking before processing completes
- Natural conversation rhythm

## Real-Time Considerations

Building voice AI is different from chatbots:

| Chatbots | Voice AI |
|----------|----------|
| User can re-read responses | One-time delivery |
| Can send long paragraphs | Must be concise |
| User types carefully | User speaks naturally (with ums, interruptions) |
| Response time less critical | Every millisecond matters |
| Can show buttons/links | Voice-only interface |

**Implications for your agents:**
- Keep responses short (under 30 words ideal)
- Anticipate interruptions
- Design for ears, not eyes
- Handle "um", "uh", and restarts gracefully

## How Atoms Handles It

Atoms manages the entire pipeline so you can focus on what your agent should say:

1. **Telephony Integration** — Connects to phone networks
2. **Real-time STT** — Fast, accurate transcription
3. **Optimized LLM** — Small models, big speed
4. **Quality TTS** — Natural-sounding voices
5. **Turn Management** — Handles interruptions and pauses

You configure the conversation logic. We handle the infrastructure.
