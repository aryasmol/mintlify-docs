Atoms offers two types of voice agents, each designed for different conversation styles. Choosing the right type is one of the first decisions you'll make when building an agent.

## Two Agent Types

| Type | Icon | Description | Best For |
|------|------|-------------|----------|
| **Single Prompt** | 📄 Document | Flexible, free-flowing conversations guided by one comprehensive prompt | FAQ, general support, open-ended discussions |
| **Conversational Flow** | 🔗 Connected nodes | Structured, goal-oriented conversations with visual workflow | Lead qualification, booking, multi-step processes |

## Single Prompt Agents

Single Prompt agents use one prompt to define their behavior. The AI interprets your instructions and handles conversations naturally, adapting to wherever the discussion goes.

**Characteristics:**
- One main prompt defines everything
- Flexible conversation paths
- AI decides response approach
- Best for unpredictable conversations

**Ideal for:**
- Customer FAQ bots
- General product information
- Basic support triage
- Creative or advisory interactions
- Simple information lookup

**Not ideal for:**
- Strict multi-step workflows
- Lead qualification with specific criteria
- Processes requiring exact sequences

---

## Conversational Flow Agents

Conversational Flow agents use a visual workflow builder. You design each step as a node, connect them with branches, and control exactly how conversations progress.

**Characteristics:**
- Visual drag-and-drop builder
- Defined conversation paths
- You control each step
- Best for predictable, goal-oriented conversations

**Ideal for:**
- Lead qualification workflows
- Appointment scheduling
- Insurance or loan intake
- Support ticket routing
- Compliance-required conversations

**Not ideal for:**
- Completely open-ended conversations
- Simple FAQ (overkill)
- When flexibility is more important than structure

## Important Note

**Agent type is separate from creation method.** 

When you click "Create Agent," you first choose a creation method (Scratch, Template, or AI-assisted), then choose your agent type. The creation method is just how you start — the agent type is what you build.
