Let's build a real agent — a simple appointment booking assistant using Conversational Flow. By the end, you'll have a working voice agent you can call.

---

## Create the Agent

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Create Agent">
    From your dashboard, click the green **Create Agent** button (top right).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose Start from Scratch">
    Select the first option.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Conversational Flow">
    Choose **Conversational Flow** — we're building a structured conversation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

You're now in the workflow builder.

## Build the Flow

You'll see a canvas with a **Start** node. Let's add the conversation.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a Greeting Node">
    Drag a **Default Node** from the left panel onto the canvas. Connect it to Start.
    
    Click the node and add a prompt:
    ```
    Hi! Thanks for calling. I can help you book an appointment. 
    What day works best for you?
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add a Confirmation Node">
    Drag another **Default Node** and connect it to your greeting.
    
    Prompt:
    ```
    Got it. And what time would you prefer — morning or afternoon?
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add an End Node">
    Drag an **End Call** node and connect it to confirmation.
    
    This wraps up the conversation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your flow: **Start → Greeting → Confirmation → End**
