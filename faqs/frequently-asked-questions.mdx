### 1. How many languages do you support?

We primarily support English, Hindi for enterprises with extremely robust controls on quality.

Apart from that, we also have support for 30+ languages
such as French, Spanish, German, Italian in Europe; Marathi, Tamil, Telegu, Kannada, Gujarati, Malayalam in India;
Arabic for the middle-east and Chinese, Japanese, Korean in Asia. However, the accuracy for these languages is limited at the moment.

### 2. Can we integrate our systems with Atoms?

Yes, atoms has a very robust API that can be integrated into any software. You can get the full list of APIs [here](/api-reference).

### 3. What integrations are supported for Atoms?

Almost every single software can be integrated in an Atom - before, during and after a call is complete.

We suggest using tools like [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), [Make.com](https://www.make.com/), [N8N](https://n8n.io/) etc. that provide easy integrations support to
1000s of third party softwares.

To get the full list of integrations, please check the [API Reference](/api-reference).

Apart from the ones mentioned above, you can also use the [API](/api-reference) to integrate Atoms into any software.

### 3. Do you provide developer support for integration?

Yes, we provide developer support for enterprise accounts with an annual account size of 100,000 USD or more. Please reach out to [support@smallest.ai](mailto:support@smallest.ai) if this fits your profile.

In case your account size is smaller, feel free to reach out to our development partners such as [Fastcode](https://www.fastcode.ai/) who can help you quickly.

### 4. What is the expected latency?

You can expect a sub 1 second latency unless you are doing actions in your system that are taking longer to return.

For example, if you are doing a long running data base call, then the latency might increase. However, there are tricks to
overcome this by adding filler words in between as shown [here](deep-dive/filler-words)

### 5. Can I use Atoms over chat?

Yes, you can use atoms over chat as well. Please refer to the [API documentation](/api-reference) to know more.

### 6. How much does it cost?

The cost depends on the volume of usage. It starts at 0.08 USD/min and goes 2-3x lower as you scale in volumes.

You can get the detailed pricing [here](https://smallest.ai/pricing) and it is also explained in depth [here](/pricing/introduction])

### 7. Do you provide on-premise deployments?
