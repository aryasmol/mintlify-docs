Getting started is extremely easy, watch the video above or the instructions below to get started!

### 1. Login

You can head to [https://atoms.smallest.ai](https://atoms.smallest.ai) and create an account.

### 2. Dashboard Overview

Once you complete onboarding, you will see this dashboard.

This dashboard contains the navigation panel on the left hand side, allowing you to quickly move across tabs. By default,
you will land on the agents dashboard. 

### 3. Create an Agent

Now there are two ways to get started, let's explore both.

#### Start from Scratch

Once you click on "Start from Scratch", you will be asked to provide a name and description to your agent. You can change these later.

OR

#### Use a Template

You can also choose one of our existing pre-built templates. Our template library is growing and by the time you read this,
we will probably have many more.

With your agent configured, it's time to see it in action!

1. **Initiate a Call:**  
   Enter your phone number in the designated panel on the right side of the interface and start a call. Your phone should ring shortly.
   
2. **Chat with Your Agent:**  
   Alternatively, use the "Chat" feature to interact via text. This is a convenient way to test and fine-tune your agent's responses.

Congratulations! You've successfully created your first Atoms agent. 🎉
